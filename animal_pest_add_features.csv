1,귀잎아카시아,Earpod wattle,Acacia auriculiformis</em> A.Cunn. ex Benth.,유입주의 생물,식물,Acacia auriculiformis,"Acacia auriculiformis, commonly known as auri, karuvel in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and aakashmani in West Bengal, is a fast-growing, crooked, gnarly tree in the family Fabaceae. It is native to Australia, Philippines, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. It grows up to 30 metres (98 ft) tall.  Acacia auriculiformis has about 47,000 seeds per kilogram (21,000/lb).

Identification
Acacia auriculiformis is an evergreen tree that grows between to 15–30 metres (49–98 ft) tall, with a trunk as high as 12 metres (39 ft) and 50 centimetres (1 ft 8 in) in diameter. The trunk is crooked and the bark vertically fissured. Roots are shallow and spreading.
It has dense foliage with an open, spreading crown. Leaves 10–16 centimetres (4–6 in) long and 1.5–2.5 centimetres (5⁄8–1 in) wide with 3–8 parallel nerves, thick, leathery and curved.
Flowers are 8 centimetres (3 in) long and in pairs, creamy yellow and sweet scented. Pods are about 6.5 by 1.5 centimetres (2+9⁄16 in × 9⁄16 in), flat, cartilaginous, glaucous, transversely veined with undulate margins. They are initially straight but on maturity become twisted with irregular spirals. Seeds are transversely held in the pod, broadly ovate to elliptical, about 4–6 by 3–4 millimetres (5⁄32 in–15⁄64 in × 15⁄128 in–5⁄32 in). At Kozhikode (Kerala, India), flocks of jungle crow (large-billed crow, Corvus macrorhynchos), grey-headed myna (chestnut-tailed starling, Sturnia malabarica) and red-whiskered bulbul (Pycnonotus jocosus) have been observed to "
2,타이완아카시아,"Acacia petit, Formosan koa, Taiwan acacia",Acacia confusa</em> Merr.,유입주의 생물,식물,Acacia confusa,"Acacia confusa is a perennial tree native to South-East Asia. Some common names for it are acacia petit feuille, Ayangile, small Philippine acacia, Formosa acacia (Taiwan acacia), Philippine Wattle, and Formosan koa. It grows to a height of 15 m. The tree has become very common in many tropical Pacific areas, including Hawaii, where the species is considered invasive.

Uses
The wood has a density of about 0.75 g/cm3. In Taiwan, its wood was used to make support beams for underground mines. Acacia confusa is challenging to work and for this reason was traditionally burned as firewood or turned into charcoal in Taiwan. In later years it was exported to China to be made into wood flooring for the American market. At its height Taiwan exported more than 1,000 containers of Taiwan acacia to China. More recently it has been used domestically to produce high value wood products like musical instruments, furniture, and bathtubs.The wood is also converted to charcoal for family use. The plant is used in traditional medicine and is available from herbal medicine shops in Taiwan, but there has been no clinical study to support its effectiveness.

Phytochemicals
Phytochemicals found in Acacia confusa:

Root bark
N-Methyltryptamine

Native to Australia, it is distributed along the west coast of Western Australia as far north as Leeman, and along the south coast into South Australia. The Noongar peoples of Western Australia know the plant as wilyawa or woolya wah.

Description
It is found in locations exposed to coastal winds, red-eyed wattle grows as a dense, dome shaped shrub; this helps protect against salt spray, sand-blast and erosion of soil at the roots.  When sheltered from the wind, it tends to grow as a small tree typically to a height of 0.8 to 4 m (2 ft 7 in to 13 ft 1 in) but can reach as high as 8 m (26 ft). Like many other Acacia species, red-eyed wattle has phyllodes rather than true leaves.  The phyllodes range from four to eight centimetres long, and from six to twelve millimetres wide.  Its flower heads are bright yellow spherical clusters.  Very few flower heads are produced at a time, but flowering occurs over a long period, from early spring to late summer, between September and May. This is unusual for Acacia species, which normally flower in one brief but impressive display.
Both the common and species names refer to the appearance of the pods when first open in late spring: each shiny black seed is encircled by a thick orange-red stalk, resembling a bloods"

Willd.,유입주의 생물,식물,Acacia farnesiana,"Vachellia farnesiana, also known as Acacia farnesiana, and previously Mimosa farnesiana, commonly known as sweet acacia, huisache, or needle bush, is a species of shrub or small tree in the legume family, Fabaceae. Its flowers are used in the perfume industry.

Description
The plant is deciduous over part of its range, but evergreen in most locales. Growing from multiple trunks, it reaches a height of 4.6–9.1 metres (15–30 feet). The bark is whitish gray. The base of each leaf is accompanied by a pair of thorns on the branch. The dark brown fruit is a seed pod.

Taxonomy
Taxonomic history
It was first described by Europeans under the name Acacia Indica Farnesiana in 1625 by Tobias Aldini from plants grown in Rome in the Farnese Gardens from seed collected in Santo Domingo, in what is now the Dominican Republic, which germinated in 1611. Aldini included an illustration of the plant, which he contrasted with an illustration of the first known Acacia; Acacia nilotica. This first (European) illustration of the plant was later designated as the (lecto-)type. In 1753, Carl Linnaeus used Aldini's work as basis for his taxon Mimosa farnesiana. In 1806 Carl Ludwig Willdenow moved this taxon to the genus Acacia.Partly due to its wide distributional range, the taxon has attracted many synonyms. Especially in the United States, the taxonomy has been confused.
In 1809, Willdenow described Acacia acicularis from Central America collected and named during Humboldt and Bonpland's scientific "

Description
The large shrub or tree up to 2 to 4 metres (7 to 13 ft) tall and has a similar width, it has ribbed branchlets that are often arched downward. It is dense with foliage; the leaves are actually enlarged petioles known as phyllodes. They are crinkly and the new ones are covered in hairs. The erect phyllodes are asymettric and have a lanceolate shape and are around 30 millimetres (1.18 in) in length and 7 mm (0.276 in) wide. The bush is also full of long spines. It usually flowers between August and November producing an axillary flower-spike with small, bright yellow spherical flower heads and the fruits are brown pods 4 to 7 centimetres (1.6 to 2.8 in) long. The hard black seeds within have an oblong shape and are about 6 mm (0.236 in) in length and half as wide.The spiny stipules that grow at the base of the phyllodes deter livestock from feeding on or too close to the plant.

Taxonomy
The species was first formally described by the botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1813 as part of the work Catalogus Plantarum Horti Botanici Monspeliensis.  
The species name is from the Greek words para which means near and doxa meaning glory. This probably refers the unattractive and thorny shrub being quite showy when it is in bloom.Many synonyms are known for the plant including; Acacia ornithophora, Acacia undul"

Native to Australia, it is widely distributed throughout the south west corner of Western Australia, extending north as far as the Murchison River, and east to Israelite Bay.
The Noongar peoples know the tree as Cujong.

Description
Acacia saligna grows as a small, dense, spreading tree with a short trunk and a weeping habit. It grows up to eight metres tall. Like many Acacia species, it has phyllodes rather than true leaves; these can be up to 25 centimetres long. At the base of each phyllode is a nectary gland, which secretes a sugary fluid. This attracts ants, which are believed to reduce the numbers of leaf-eating insects. The yellow flowers appear in late winter and early spring, in groups of up to ten bright yellow spherical flower heads. The fruit is a legume, while the seed is oblong and dark to black in colour.A natural colonizer, Coojong tends to grow wherever soil has been disturbed, such as alongside new roads. Its seeds are distributed by ants, which store them in their nests to eat the seed-stalks. Disturbance of the soil brings them to the surface and allows them to germinate. Seeds germinate readily, and hundreds of seedlings can sometimes be found beneath a single parent tree. It is also extremely vigorous when young, often grow"

Description
Rumex sagittatus is a soft-stemmed herbaceous scrambling and climbing plant with prominent triangular arrow-shaped leaves 3–6 cm (1.2–2.4 in) in length and 2–4 cm (0.8–1.6 in) wide. The grooved green stem may be distinctly tinted red at times. The small pinkish flowers grow on panicles up to 15 cm (6 in) long. These are followed by a 3-sided greenish 0.8–1 cm diameter pod. The plant grows from a tuber, which may be up to 10 cm (4 in) long. The plant flowers and sets seed over summer, and may die back to the tuber in colder areas.

Taxonomy
Rumex sagittatus was first described in 1794 by Swedish botanist Carl Peter Thunberg. It was later placed in the genus Acetosa by Australian botanists Lawrie Johnson and Barbara Briggs, a placement not accepted by other sources, such as Plants of the World Online. Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin sagittus ""arrow"", hence ""arrow-shaped"". The plant is known by various common names including turkey rhubarb, arrowhead vine, potato vine, rambling dock or climbing sorrel.

Distribution and habitat
The plant is native to southern Africa, where it occurs from Malawi and Zambia south to South Africa. It has become naturalised in many parts of Australia near urban areas, from Queensland to eastern Tasmani"

It is found patchily distributed across much of the mainland of the Indian Subcontinent but absent in the arid zones of India. It is easily recognized by the tuft of feathers on its forehead that form a frontal crest, a feature also found in the closely related Javan myna and the pale-bellied myna which were treated as a subspecies in the past. The eyes are pale, yellow or blue depending on the population and the base of the orange-yellow bill is dark. It has also been introduced either intentionally or accidentally into many other parts of the world including Fiji, Taiwan, the Andaman Islands, and parts of Japan. The species has also spread out on its own to some islands in the Pacific.

Description
Jungle mynas are 23-centimetre (9.1 in) long and have grey plumage, darker on the head and wings. The sexes are indistinguishable in plumage. A large white wing patches on the base of the primaries becomes conspicuous in flight, and the tail feathers are broadly tipped in white. There is a tuft of feathers on the forehead arising at the base of the bill. The bill and legs are bright yellow, and there is no bare skin around eye as in the common myna and the bank myna. The base of the beak is dark in adults with a shade of blue at the base of the lower mandible. The southern Indian population has a blue iris.

17,회색뿔찌르레기,,Acridotheres ginginianus</em>,유입주의 생물,조류,Acridotheres ginginianus,"The bank myna (Acridotheres ginginianus) is a myna found in the northern parts of South Asia. It is smaller but similar in colouration to the common myna, only differing in having brick-red naked skin behind the eyes instead of yellow. It is greyer on the underside and in this and in the presence of a slight tuft of feathers bears some resemblance to the jungle myna. They are found in flocks on the plains of northern and central India, often within towns and cities. Their range appears to be extending southwards into India. The name is derived from their habit of nesting almost exclusively in the earthen banks of rivers, where they excavate burrows and breed in large colonies.

Description
The head is black on the crown and sides and the upper plumage is slaty grey while the underside is lighter grey with pale pink plumage towards the centre of the abdomen. The wing is black but has a wing patch at the base of the primaries and the tips of the outer tail feathers are pale pinkish buff. The naked skin behind the eye is brick red, the legs are yellow while the iris is deep red. The sexes are indistinguishable in the field. Young birds have a browner head and neck.The species is evolutionarily closest to the common myna.

It is a member of the starling family. It is native to Bali and Java. It has been introduced to other Asian countries, and as far away as Puerto Rico.

Taxonomy
The Javan myna is sometimes included in the great myna (Acridotheres grandis) or the jungle myna (A. fuscus). The International Ornithologists' Union recommends not using the name ""white-vented myna"" to avoid confusion with the Pale-bellied Myna A. cinereus.

Description
The Javan myna is mainly black. The wings are brownish-black, and the primaries have white bases, displayed in flight as a striking white wing bar, along a white tail bar. The undertail-coverts are white. There is a short crest on the forehead. Its beak, legs and feet are yellow. The eyes are lemon-yellow. The immature is browner. Its length is 21–23 cm (8.3–9.1 in). Its weight is about 100 g (3.5 oz).

Habitat
The Javan myna is native to Bali and Java, and has been introduced to southeastern Thailand, southern Malaysia, Singapore, Sumatra, the Lesser Sundas, Taiwan, Puerto Rico, Japan and Nepal. It is found in cities and cultivated areas.

Behaviour
The Javan myna is omnivorous and eats seeds, fruit, nectar, insects and human waste. It is often found in large groups. Its voice is similar to that of the common myna. It builds its nest in holes. The eggs are bluish-glaucous. Javan mynas are bold and not very afraid of humans. Javan mynas are kept in cage"

An omnivorous open woodland bird with a strong territorial instinct, the common myna has adapted extremely well to urban environments.
The range of the common myna is increasing at such a rapid rate that in 2000 the IUCN Species Survival Commission declared it one of the world's most invasive species and one of only three birds listed among ""100 of the World's Worst Invasive Species"" that pose a threat to biodiversity, agriculture and human interests. In particular, the species poses a serious threat to the ecosystems of Australia, where it was named ""The Most Important Pest/Problem"" in 2008.

Taxonomy
In 1760, the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the common myna in his Ornithologie, based on a specimen that he mistakenly believed had been collected in the Philippines. He used the French name Le merle des Philippines and the Latin Merula Philippensis. Although Brisson coined Latin names, they do not conform to the binominal system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature.When the Swedish naturalist, Carl Linnaeus, updated his Systema Naturae in 1766, for the 12th edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of them was the common myna. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binominal name Paradisea tristis and cited Brisson's "

22,가시염소풀,,Aegilops triuncialis</em> L.,유입주의 생물,식물,Aegilops triuncialis,"Aegilops triuncialis, or barbed goatgrass, is a grass species of the family Poaceae. It is a winter annual native to many areas in Eastern and Mediterranean Europe and Western Asia.  It is considered an introduced, invasive species in North America, mainly in the Western coast of the United States. In its native lands, the grass thrives in mainly rocky, serpentine soil, but also does well in grasslands and ruderal/disturbed ground as well as oak woodlands.

Description
Barbed goatgrass grows to be about 8 to 16 inches (20 to 41 cm) tall with few to many rigid, loosely erect aerial stems (culms).  In late spring the plant produces rigid flower spikes consisting of three to six spikelets bearing long, stiff awns which assist in seed distribution. When the grass matures, the spikelets fall off in their entirety to germinate on the ground, and the long awns which give the plant its name assist in dispersal by animals, wind or water.

As an invasive species
Barbed goatgrass was introduced to North America in the 20th century from Mediterranean Europe and Western Asia.  It has been found in California, Oregon, Nevada, and the New England area, but with the greatest impact in California.  Barbed goatgrass was introduced to the California area with the trade of Mexican cattle in the early 20th century. The plant's unusual ability to invade nutrient-depleted, infertile soils means that it can severely damage habitats which often serve as important refugia for endemic grassland species"

It is the only member of the genus Aethusa. It is related to hemlock and water-dropwort, and like them it is poisonous, though less so than hemlock. It has been introduced into many other parts of the world and is a common weed in cultivated ground.

Description
It has a fusiform root and a smooth hollow branched stem growing to about 80 cm (31 in) high, with much divided (ternately pinnate) smooth leaves with an unpleasant smell, and small compound umbels of small irregular white flowers.

Toxicity
Poisoning from fool's parsley results in symptoms of heat in the mouth and throat and a post-mortem examination has shown redness of the lining membrane of the gullet and windpipe and slight congestion of the duodenum and stomach. Some toxins are destroyed by drying, and indeed, hay containing the plant is not poisonous.

Agropyron cristatum subsp. desertorum (Fisch. ex Link) A. Löve, Agropyron cristatum var. desertorum (Fisch. ex Link) Dorn) is a plant species in the family Poaceae which was originally from Russian and Siberian steppes until it was introduced to the United States from there between 1907 and 1913. Prior to its introduction it was believed that Desert wheatgrass and crested wheatgrass are different species. Currently it can still be found in Central and Western United States, except for Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Washington.

Agricultural significance
Agropyron desertorum is a perennial crop that is grown in areas across North America. Since it can be regrown over many years, A. desertorum has become a useful crop within the agricultural field. This plant species is a type of crested wheatgrass that is used as a common grazing crop.  It is especially used for beef cattle that are raised for human food production. A study was performed to test the specific cattle grazing preferences for different types of crested wheatgrass. Diploid cultivars of crested wheatgrasses were compared to tetraploid cultivars of Agropyron desertorum. The varying ploidy numbers of the plants resulted in inherent differences between the plants and subsequently, specific grazing preferences for the cattle. The study showed that the cattle significantly prefe"

It is found in Iran, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Slovakia, Moldova, Greece, Czechia, Azerbaijan, Turkiye, Afghanistan, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

Description
The Danube bleak is an elongate slim fish which can reach 40 centimetres (16 in) but a more normal size is 15 to 30 centimetres (6 to 12 in). There are 57 to 70 scales along the lateral line. The abdomen is compressed into a keel and the posterior end of this has no scales. The dorsal fin has eight to nine branched rays while the anal fin has fifteen to nineteen. This fish is morphologically quite variable which may be due to local adaptations to various habitats but is more likely to be due to several species being involved.

Distribution
The Danube bleak occurs in slow flowing stretches of rivers flowing into the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea and in the Aral Sea basin, in Alpine rivers among others. It is a migratory fish, spawning in the headwaters of the rivers and then moving down to the lower parts, estuaries and brackish areas of sea. These migratory patterns have been disrupted by the building of dams across many of the rivers. Landlocked populations survive in small rivers and reservoirs, breeding in the small streams above the dams. The main Caspian Sea population has fou"

This shrub is native to the region extending from the Mediterranean to Russia, but has been introduced to many other areas of the world, including Australia, southern Africa, and the western United States. The perennial plant grows from a massive rhizome system which may extend over six feet into the ground. New shoots can appear over 20 feet from the parent plant. Above the ground, the plant rarely reaches four feet in height. It is a heavily branched, gray-green thicket with long spines along the branches. It bears small, bright pink to maroon pea flowers and small legume pods, which are brown or reddish and constricted between the seeds. The seeds are mottled brown beans.

Distribution
Alhagi maurorum is indigenous to temperate and tropical Eurasia and the Middle East, in: Afghanistan; Armenia; Azerbaijan; northwest China; Cyprus; northern India; Iran; Iraq; Israel; Jordan; Kazakhstan; Kuwait; Lebanon; Mongolia; Pakistan; Syria; Tajikistan; Turkey; Turkmenistan; Uzbekistan; and Russia (in Ciscaucasia, Dagestan, southern European Russia, and the southern part of the West Siberian Plain).A. maurorum has become naturalized in Australia and the southwest U.S.

29,이집트기러기,,Alopochen aegyptiaca</em>,유입주의 생물,조류,Alopochen aegyptiaca,"The Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiaca) is an African member of the duck family Anatidae. Because of their popularity chiefly as an ornamental bird, the species has also been introduced to Europe, United States and elsewhere outside their natural range. Egyptian geese were considered sacred by the Ancient Egyptians, and appeared in much of their artwork.

Taxonomy
The Egyptian goose is believed to be most closely related to the shelducks (genus Tadorna) and their relatives, and is placed with them in the subfamily Tadorninae. It is the only extant member of the genus Alopochen, which also contains closely related prehistoric and recently extinct species. mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data suggest that the relationships of Alopochen to Tadorna need further investigation.

Etymology
The generic name Alopochen (literally, fox-goose) is based on Greek ἀλωπός (alōpós, also ἀλώπηξ alōpēx), ""fox"", and χήν (chēn) ""goose"", referring to the ruddy colour of its back. The word χήν : chēn is grammatically of either masculine or feminine gender.
The species name aegyptiacus (or aegyptiaca) is from the Latin Aegyptiacus, ""Egyptian"".

Description
It swims well and in flight looks heavy, more like a goose than a duck, hence the English name. It is 63–73 cm (25–29 in) long.
The sexes of this species are identical in plumage but the males average slightly larger. There is a fair amount of variation in plumage tone, with some birds greyer and others browner, but this is not sex- or age-related. "

The American shad is not closely related to the other North American shads.  Rather, it seems to form a lineage that diverged from a common ancestor of the European taxa before these diversified.The American shad has been described as ""the fish that fed the (American) nation's founders"".  Adult shad weigh between 1.5 and 3.5 kg (3 and 8 lb),  and they have a delicate flavor when cooked.  It is considered flavorful enough to not require sauces, herbs, or spices. It can be boiled, filleted and fried in butter, or baked. Traditionally, a little vinegar is sprinkled over it on the plate. In the Eastern United States, roe shads (females) are prized because the eggs are considered a delicacy.The name ""shad"" derives from the Old English sceadd, meaning ""herring""; it is a cognate to Irish, Welsh, and Scottish Gaelic words for herring.

Life history
The shad spends most of its life in the Atlantic Ocean, but swims up freshwater rivers to spawn.  Northern populations are iteroparous, thus they may survive breeding, return to the sea, and then return to fresh waters to spawn several more times.  However, southern populations exhibit semelparity, similar to Pacific salmon.  In the marine environment, shad are schooling fish.  Thousands are often seen at "

It also has barbels located near its mouth, a broad head, spiny fins, and no scales. It can be identified from other bullheads as the barbels are black, and it has a tan crescent around the tail. Its caudal fin is truncated (squared off at the corners). Like virtually all catfish, it is nocturnal, preferring to feed at night, although young feed during the day.  It generally does not get as large as the channel or blue catfish, with average adult weights are in the 1-to-2-pound (0.45 to 0.91 kg) range, and almost never as large as 4 pounds (1.8 kg). It has a typical length of 6–14 inches (15–36 cm), with the largest specimen being 24 inches (61 cm), making it the largest of the bullheads. It is typically black or dark brown on the dorsal side of its body and yellow or white on the ventral side.Like most of the bullheads (and even flathead catfish), it has a squared tail fin, which is strikingly different from the forked tail of channel and blue catfish.

It was originally described as Pimelodus nebulosus by Charles Alexandre Lesueur in 1819, and is also referred to as Ictalurus nebulosus.
The brown bullhead is also widely known as the ""mud pout"", ""horned pout"", ""hornpout"", or simply ""mud cat"", a name also used with the other bullhead species.

39,보핀,Bowfin,Amia calva</em>,유입주의 생물,어류,Amia calva,"The bowfin (Amia calva) is a bony fish, native to North America. Common names include mudfish, mud pike, dogfish, grindle, grinnel, swamp trout, and choupique. It is regarded as a relict, being one of only two surviving species of the Halecomorphi, a group of fish that first appeared during the Early Triassic, around 250 million years ago. The bowfin is often considered a ""primitive fish"" because they have retained some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors. It is one of two species in the genus Amia, along with Amia ocellicauda, the eyespot bowfin. The closest living relatives of bowfins are gars, with the two groups being united in the clade Holostei.
Bowfins are demersal freshwater piscivores, commonly found throughout much of the eastern United States, and in southern Ontario and Quebec. Fossil deposits indicate Amiiformes were once widespread in both freshwater and marine environments  across North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Now, their range is limited to much of the eastern United States and adjacent southern Canada, including the drainage basins of the Mississippi River, Great Lakes, and various rivers exiting in the Eastern Seaboard or Gulf of Mexico. Their preferred habitat includes vegetated sloughs, lowland rivers and lakes, swamps, and backwater areas; they are also occasionally found in brackish water.

In the aquarium trade A. citrinellus is often sold under the trade name of Midas cichlid. A. citrinellus are omnivorous and their diet consists of plant material, molluscs and smaller fish. The species is closely related to, but not to be mistaken for, Amphilophus labiatus, which shares the nickname red devil cichlid.

Physical characteristics
Midas cichlids are heavily built and are capable of standing up to any other aquarium-sized cichlid in fights over territory. They have powerful jaws, sharp teeth and a physical size advantage in comparison to other aquarium species. Therefore, the aggressivity of Midas cichlids should not be underestimated and cohabitants should be chosen carefully in an aquarium setting.

Taxonomic status
Considerable debate over the taxonomic status of A. citrinellus began soon after the discovery of this species in the nineteenth century and continued throughout the twentieth century. A multivariate approach to treatment of anatomical characters has facilitated the discrimination among very similarly shaped species, aided by behavioral and ecological evidence. Multiple species of this group have been identified and verified by genomic and mitochondrial DNA evidence in volcanic crater lakes Apoyo and Xiloá. The genetic evidence from Apoyo supports a hypothesis that the six known species of the lake evolved via sympatric s"

Distribution
The amphibian is native throughout the Canadian Prairies (northern Great Plains) in southern Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan; and into northern Mexico in the Sonoran Desert and Mexican Plateau.

Description
The Great Plains toad is grey, brown, and green in color, with darker colored blotching. It can grow to anywhere between 5.1 and 11.4 cm (2 and 4.5 in) in length. Its primary diet is various species of cutworms. It prefers grassland habitat with loose soil that is easy to burrow in. Breeding occurs throughout the spring and summer months, most often immediately after heavy rainfall. In dry areas it may only emerge from its burrow for a few weeks when conditions are right, and usually at night, but in areas with permanent water bodies and abundant rain it may be active all day. Its mating call is a very loud, harsh chirping noise repeated many times, very fast.

Ecology
The great plains toad feeds a range of insects such as lepidopterans, dipterans, hymenopterans, coleopterans, ants, and termites. The toad is preyed upon by the plains garter snake (Thamnophis radix), among others. It uses chemoreceptors to sense chemical cues left by the snake.

Description
It is a small toad species growing to 3.7 to 7.5 cm (1.5 to 3.0 in) in length. It has a flattened head and body, and a light grey, olive or reddish brown dorsum with reddish or orange skin glands. It has a whitish or buff venter with or without faint dark spotting, and round parotoid glands. The snout is pointed. The juvenile toad looks similar to the adult, but has more prominent ventral spotting and the undersides of its feet are yellow. The male red-spotted toad has a dusky throat and develops nuptial pads during the breeding season.It may hybridize with the western toad (Anaxyrus boreas) in some locations, possibly with other toad species too. It is docile and easily handled with little or no skin gland secretions.

Description
The oak toad can be identified by its light mid-dorsal stripe, variable brown and black spots, and proportionally large parotoid glands. One of the most remarkable features of this species is its small adult size relative to other toads.  The male can be distinguished from the female by his clear white belly and a slightly distended, loose flap of skin beneath the mouth, which expands into the vocal sac. The female has a dark-spotted belly and lacks a vocal sac.

Description
This tufting perennial bunchgrass can grow 4 m (13 ft) tall and 70 cm (2.3 ft) in diameter, and has hairy leaves. Most of its roots are fibrous, spreading close to the surface of the soil for up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in), but it also has thick cord roots which store starch and anchor the plant as well as vertical roots able to extract water from a greater depth during the dry season.It produces large numbers of light, fluffy seeds (up to 244,000 seeds each year, with 65% viability), which can be spread by wind, animals or machinery. It spreads rapidly where vegetation is disturbed, but most seeds fall within 5 m (16 ft) of the parent plant.

Habitat

It is a member of the A. chrysolepis species group.In A. lineatus, males reach about 7–7.5 cm (2.8–3.0 in) in snout-to-vent length and the females about 6 cm (2.4 in). It is overall light brownish with a dark-edged pale lateral stripe on each side, and typically several light bars on the body and tail. It has an orange-yellow dewlap with a blackish spot; the dewlap is significantly larger in males than in females. It is the only known species of anole where the dewlap is asymmetrically coloured, being deeper orange on one side and yellower on the other. In almost three-quarter of all individuals the left side is the most yellow. The colour difference between the two sides is indistinct in only a minority of the females.

The species is native to Cuba and the Bahamas. It has been widely introduced elsewhere, via the importation and exportation of plants where the anole would lay eggs in the soil of the pots, and is now found in Florida and as far north in the United States as southern Georgia, Texas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Hawaii, and Southern California. It has also been introduced to other Caribbean islands, Mexico, and Taiwan.
This species is highly invasive. 
In its introduced range, it reaches exceptionally high population densities, is capable of expanding its range very quickly, and both outcompetes and consumes many species of native lizards, like the green anole.  The brown anole's introduction into the United States in the early 1970s has altered the behavior and negatively affected populations of the native Carolina anole (Anolis carolinensis, also known as the green anole), which have since generally been relegated to the treetops.

Etymology
The specific name, sagrei, is in honor of Spanish botanist Ramón de la Sagra.

Description

Geographic range
Anolis wattsii is native to Antigua, and has also been introduced to Saint Lucia.

Taxonomy
Anolis pogus was formerly described as a subspecies of A. wattsii.  The taxonomy of two further subspecies, sometimes described as A. schwartzi and A. forresti, is unclear.  At a minimum, the three taxa are very closely related, and similar in appearance, ecology, and behavior.  A. w. schwartzi is found on Sint Eustatius, Saint Kitts, and Nevis.  A. w. forresti is endemic to Barbuda.

Etymology
The specific name, wattsii, is in honor of Dr. Sir Francis Watts who became the Commissioner of Agriculture for the West Indies.

The combination of fleshy leaves and thick aerial tubers makes this a very heavy vine. It smothers trees and other vegetation it grows on and can easily break branches and bring down entire trees on its own. Other names include lamb's tail and potato vine.

Description
Anredera cordifolia is an evergreen climber that grows from fleshy rhizomes. It has bright green, heart-shaped, fleshy shiny leaves 4–13 centimetres (1.6–5.1 in) long. Wart-like tubers are produced on aerial stems and are a key to identifying the plant.
From late summer to autumn, it produces masses of small, fragrant (cardamom-like), cream-coloured flowers on dependent racemes, which may be up to 30 cm (12 in) in length. The plant spreads via the tubers, which detach very easily.

Reproduction
Anredera cordifolia can reproduce through the proliferation of tubers and also from rhizome fragments that may be broken off. Although this species has both male and female flowers they rarely reproduce sexually and produce seed.
This species often spreads through its own vegetative growth, but can easily be transported by human activities. If fragments end up in waterways, they may be readily transported to new locations in this manner.Seedlings were found well away from habitation, roads and streams in Australia from 1988 onward, leading to the conclusion that t"

It is also found in neighboring KwaZulu-Natal.

Description
Arctotheca calendula is a squat perennial or annual which grows in rosettes and sends out stolons and can spread across the ground quickly. The leaves are covered with white woolly hairs, especially on their undersides. The leaves are lobed or deeply toothed. Hairy stems bear daisy-like flowers with small yellow petals that sometimes have a green or purple tint surrounded by white or yellow ray petals extending further out from the flower centers.

Cultivation
It is cultivated as an attractive ornamental groundcover but has invasive potential when introduced to a new area. The plant can reproduce vegetatively or via seed. Seed-bearing plants are most likely to become weedy, taking hold most easily in bare or sparsely vegetated soil or disturbed areas.

Spread
Arctotheca calendula is naturalized in California, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Australia,  New Zealand,and Chile,and considered a noxious weed in some of those places.

Description
Ardisia elliptica is a tropical understory shrub that can reach heights of up 5 meters. Undamaged plants in forest habitats are characterized by a single stem, producing short, perpendicular branches. Leaves are elliptic to elliptic-obovate, entire, leathery and alternate. Umbellate inflorescences develop in leaf axils of branch leaves. Petals are light pink. Fruits are drupes that first turn red as they mature and then deep purple / black. Pulp staining fingers a deep purple. Seeds are approximately spherical with a diameter of about 5 mm.

Other vernacular names are Lusitanian slug, Iberian slug, and killer slug.
It is a large, conspicuous slug, which has spread across much of Europe since the 1950s and now reached North America. It may attain high densities and be a serious horticultural and agricultural pest. The life cycle is annual, with adults appearing in summer and dying off before winter.

Confusion over nomenclature
The Spanish slug was identified as Arion lusitanicus when it was first reported as an invading species in France in 1956, and hence it is sometimes called the Lusitanian slug (e.g.). This was a case of misidentification. In slugs, it is often impossible to find external characters that distinguish closely related species using external features, as colouration can be quite variable, and the rather plastic anatomy makes diagnostic anatomical features difficult to establish. The current consensus is that the true Arion lusitanicus is a species of the western part of the Iberian Peninsula. Examination of slugs from the Serra da Arrábida mountains in Portugal from where it was originally described by Jules François Mabille in 1868 showed that the true A. lusitanicus differed from the invader in its internal anatomy, the shape of the spermatophore and the number o"

Often used as an ornamental plant, it is considered an invasive weed in many locations. Asparagus fern, asparagus grass and foxtail fern are common names; however, it is unrelated to true ferns. A. aethiopicus has been confused with A. densiflorus, now regarded as a separate species, so that information about A. aethiopicus will often be found under the name A. densiflorus.

Name and description
The species was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1767. The attribution ""Sprenger's Asparagus,"" refers to Carl Ludwig Sprenger who made it popular in Europe as an ornamental plant.
Asparagus aethiopicus is a branching perennial herb with tough green aerial stems which are sparsely covered with spines. 
The oval-shaped leaves are actually leaf-like cladodes, which are 0.8–2 cm long and 0.1-0.2 cm wide, and arise in groups of four or more from the stem. Occurring in spring, the small white or pinkish-white flowers are 0.3-0.5 cm long and arise in clusters off the stem. Flowers are followed in summer by small round berries 0.5 cm in diameter, which bear a black 3 mm diameter seed. Initially green, the berries mature and turn red in the winter. The root system is a mat of fibrous roots with bulbous water storage tubers, originating from a toughened ""crown"" at the base of the leaves, this crown including fragments left in the ground may resprout.

Sometimes grown as an ornamental plant, it has become a serious environmental weed in Australia and New Zealand.

Taxonomy
Linnaeus first described this species as Medeola asparagoides in 1753. It has been reclassified in the genus Asparagus by W. Wight in 1909, or Myrsiphyllum by  Carl Ludwig von Willdenow in 1808.

Description
Asparagus asparagoides grows as a herbaceous vine with a scrambling or climbing habit which can reach 3 m (10 ft) in length. It has shiny green leaf-like structures (phylloclades) which are flattened stems rather than true leaves. They measure up to 4 cm long by 2 cm wide. The pendent white flowers appear over winter and spring, from July to September. It is rhizomatous, and bears tubers which reach 6 cm (2.4 in) by 2 cm (1.8 in) in size.

Distribution and habitat
It ranges throughout tropical Africa, south to Namibia, and the fynbos in South Africa, as far south as Cape Town.It has become naturalised in parts of southern California and Australia, where it is considered an invasive plant.

Uses
Asparagus asparagoides, often under the name smilax, is commonly used in floral arrangements or home decorating.

Description
This fine, delicate looking creeper is actually quite hardy. It prefers shady areas and moisture, but can tolerate some drought. Its soft, feathery foliage is a deep, rich green and unlike other asparagus ferns, this species does not grow thorns.

Distribution and habitat
This tough little creeper is indigenous to the shady afro-montane forests of the Western Cape, South Africa. Here it can be found from the indigenous woods and kloofs of Cape Town, eastwards as far as the Tsitsikamma Mountains.
Cultivated in South African gardens, it is a very useful ornamental plant for growing in deep shade. It will climb up any sticks, pillars or trellises that are available, but if there is nothing for it to climb up, it will simply form a thick, feathery groundcover.
It grows many tiny white drooping flowers that are followed by little orange fruits. These attract birds which help to disperse them.
It is best propagated from seed.
A. scandens is an invasive species in some countries. In New Zealand it is listed on the National Pest Plant Accord, which means that it cannot be sold or distributed. In Australia it is listed on the Weeds of National Significance, a list of 32 taxa compiled by the federal government.

Populations tend to be scattered between suitable savannah or cropland habitats, avoiding forested areas. The species common name is derived from the number of toes found on its hind feet. Due to its extensive range and stable wild population, the species is rated as least concern by the IUCN. In addition, the species is a popular small pet in various countries, and has been successfully domesticated and bred in captivity.
There are no universally agreed subspecies of A. albiventris.

Description
The four-toed hedgehog is an oval bodied animal approximately 210 millimetres (8.3 in) in length and weighing between 250 and 600 grams (8.8 and 21.2 oz). Females are typically larger than males. It has short legs, short tail typically around 2.5 centimetres (0.98 in) in length, a long nose, and small beady eyes. The ears and whiskers are both relatively large, implying that the animal has good senses. As its common name implies, and unlike related species, the four-toed hedgehog typically only has 4 toes on each hind foot, lacking the hallux. However, in some individuals, a small bony lump may be present in place of the hallux, or there may even be a well-developed toe, especially on the hind feet.It can vary greatly in colouration, but typical wild specimens have brown or grey spines with white or cream colored tips.

It is the largest species in the gar family (Lepisosteidae), and is among the largest freshwater fish in North America. The fossil record traces its group's existence back to the Early Cretaceous over 100 million years ago. Gars are often referred to as ""primitive fishes"" or ""living fossils,"" because they have retained some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors, such as a spiral valve intestine, which is also common to the digestive system of sharks, and the ability to breathe in both air and water. Their common name was derived from their resemblance to the American alligator, particularly their broad snouts and long, sharp teeth. Anecdotal evidence suggests that an alligator gar can grow up to 10 ft (3.0 m) in length.
The body of an alligator gar is torpedo-shaped, usually brown or olive colored, fading to a lighter gray or yellow ventral surface. In very rare occurrences, they can also be black, seen in gars that have a high level of melanin. Their scales are not like the scales of other fishes; rather, they are ganoid scales, which are bone-like, rhomboidal-shaped scales, often with serrated edges, and covered by an enamel-like substance. Ganoid scales are nearly impenetrable, and are excellent protection against predation. Unlike other gar species, the upper jaw of an alligator gar has a "

Its bite is capable of causing serious illness or death in humans if left untreated.The Sydney funnel-web has a body length ranging from 1 to 5 cm (0.4 to 2 in). Both sexes are glossy and darkly coloured, ranging from blue-black, to black, to shades of brown or dark-plum coloured.

Taxonomy
Octavius Pickard-Cambridge was the first to describe the Sydney funnel-web spider, from a female specimen housed in the British Museum in 1877. Establishing the genus Atrax, he named it Atrax robustus. The species name is derived from the Latin robustus, ""strong/sturdy/mature"". Some years later, William Joseph Rainbow described a male Sydney funnel-web as a new species—Euctimena tibialis—from a spider he found under a log in Turramurra, and another from Mosman. He coined the scientific name from Ancient Greek euktimenos, ""well-built"", and Latin tibialis, ""of the tibia"", having noted its prominent tibial spur. In the same paper, he described a female Sydney funnel-web spider as yet another species—Poikilomorpha montana—from a specimen collected from Jamison Valley and Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains. Its species name was derived from poikilomorphia, ""variety of form"", referring to the eyes of different sizes, and montana, ""of the mounta"

A closely related species, Badumna longinqua, the grey house spider, has a similar distribution, but has also been introduced to the Americas.Ludwig Carl Christian Koch described Badumna insignis in 1872.

Description
B. insignis is a dark, robust spider. The female grows up to 18 mm, with a 30 mm leg span. As with most spiders, the males are smaller (10 mm) and have longer legs in relation to their body size. In both sexes, the carapace and legs are dark brown to black, and the abdomen is charcoal grey with a dorsal pattern of light markings (sometimes indistinct) and a dense covering of fine, velvety hair. B. longinqua is slightly bigger (14 mm) with a greyish carapace and black-brown legs.

Habits, mating, and reproduction
The web of B. insignis is a messy-looking construct of irregular sail-like shapes. There is a funnel-shaped, silken retreat, usually in the middle or corner of the web, where the spider spends most of its time waiting for prey.  The female spider never leaves the web unless forced to. They seem quite attached to their location, rarely changing the position of their webs and because of this, old webs can be quite messy, often with small objects or dust stuck in them. At night the spider comes out to repair and add to the web, often just adding new silk over the old. Males, when ready to mate, go in sear"

It is native to Indochina and to the province of Yunnan in southern China, but it has been widely cultivated in many other places and has become naturalized in several regions. Among bamboo species, it is one of the largest and most easily recognized.

Description
Bambusa vulgaris forms moderately loose clumps and has no thorns. It has lemon-yellow culms (stems) with green stripes and dark green leaves. Stems are not straight, not easy to split, inflexible, thick-walled, and initially strong. The densely tufted culms grow 10–20 m (30–70 ft) high and 4–10 cm (2–4 in) thick. 
Culms are basally straight or flexuose (bent alternately in different directions), drooping at the tips. Culm walls are slightly thick.
Nodes are slightly inflated. Internodes are 20–45 cm (7.9–17.7 in). Several branches develop from mid-culm nodes and above. Culm leaves are deciduous with dense pubescence. Leaf blades are narrowly lanceolate.Flowering is not common, and there are no seeds. Fruits are rare due to low pollen viability caused by irregular meiosis. At the interval of several decades, the whole population of an area blooms at once, and individual stems bear a large number of flowers. Vegetation propagates through clump division, by rhizome, stem and branch cutting, layering, and marcotting. The easiest and most practised cultivation method is culm or branch cutting.

The name barbel derived from the Latin barba, meaning beard, a reference to the two pairs of barbels,  a longer pair pointing forwards and slightly down positioned, on the side of the mouth.

Description
Barbus plebejus can reach a maximum length of 70 cm in males and a maximum weight of 6 kilograms. Usually, it is much smaller. It has a long and slender body, with a mouth equipped with characteristic four barbels (hence the common and genus names). It has greenish back with black dots, sides finely dotted, whitish belly, paired fins tinged with grey and a slightly thorny dorsal ray. Lower lip has a median lobe.

Distribution
The species is found in Croatia, Italy, Slovenia and Switzerland.

Habitat
Like the common barbel, these long-lived fishes have their natural habitats in running waters of rivers and rarely freshwater lakes. They inhabit the water just above the bottom (benthopelagic), feeding on benthic invertebrates, small fish and algae. They also migrate within freshwater (potamodromous), for spawning purposes. It is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN.

This snake is infamous for being an invasive species responsible for extirpating the majority of the native bird population in Guam.  It is also one of the very few colubrids found in Australia, where elapids are more common.

Diet
The brown tree snake preys upon birds, lizards, bats, and mice and other small rodents in its native range.  It preys on birds and shrews in Guam. Their presence threatens species of regional native birds and lizards such as the common sparrow.Owing to the availability of prey and lack of predators in introduced habitats such as Guam, they have been known to grow to larger sizes than their normal 1 to 2 m (3.3 to 6.6 ft) in length. The longest recorded length of this species is one found on Guam measuring 3 m (9.8 ft).

Reproduction
The reproductive characteristics of the brown tree snake have not been widely studied.  The female is known to produce 4 to 12 oblong eggs, 42–47 mm (1.7–1.9 in) long and 18–22 mm (0.71–0.87 in) wide with leathery shells.

Description
It gets its name from the greenish to blackish coloration of its head. Neonates and juveniles do not exhibit this dark color on the head until adulthood. The body color ranges greatly from brown, orange, red, and even black. The ventral region of the snake is yellowish below the neck and white for the rest.

Subspecies
Two subspecies are recognized:
Boiga nigriceps nigriceps (Günther, 1863)
Boiga nigriceps brevicauda Smith, 1926

Distribution
Indonesia, Borneo, Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand.

Habitat
The black-headed cat snake is arboreal, but frequently comes down to the ground in search of prey. They occupy lowland and mid-elevation tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.

Venom
Little is known about the black-headed cat snake's venom toxicity on humans, but it is thought to be comparable to the severity of a copperhead. This rear fanged colubrid's bite rarely results in adverse effects due to its poor venom delivery system. Luckily their fangs' positioning doesn't result in any significant envenomation.
Symptoms tend to stay localized to the envenomation site, limiting the victim to minor pain.

Diet
The black-headed cat snake feeds on lizards, frogs, birds, small mammals and other snakes in the wild.

It is known for its red colored belly used to ward off predators, an example of aposematism, and its distinctive ""whoop"" call.

Description
The European fire-bellied toad is a medium sized frog, growing up to approximately 5.6 centimetres (2+3⁄16 in). The dorsal coloration can vary from gray to brown to green, while the stomach is red with thick black mottling. The backs of these frogs are covered in warts.
When threatened by a predator, the fire-bellied toad will lift up its arms (sometimes flipping over) to expose its red coloration and show off its toxicity to the potential predator. This is known as Unkenreflex, and is an example of aposematism.

Distribution
The European fire-bellied toad is found throughout Central and Eastern Europe. More particularly, its range starts in eastern Germany (including eastern Denmark and parts of southern Sweden), and then east to the Volga District of Russia where they are stopped by the Ural Mountains.

The toad is distributed mainly across western Europe as well as a handful of countries in eastern Europe. While the population of the toad is steadily decreasing over time, its numbers are not critical enough to be considered threatened or extinct. Conservation efforts in Germany are taking place to remedy the declining population before it is too late.
The toad is characterized by its bright ‘yellow belly,’ and has a dark brown and green dorsal body. The toad displays crypsis to camouflage itself from predators. It also positions itself to display yellow coloration when facing a threat. The warts found on the dorsal side allow for the toad's toxins to be readily excreted when needed.
The yellow-bellied toad is fascinating species to study because of its breeding choices; it chooses calculated risk when deciding to breed in shallow, unpredictable locations. Due to its breeding and egg laying behavior, climate change and habitat fragmentation heavily impact this species.

Distribution and habitat
The Texas toad is native to the United States where it is found in the state of Texas, wherein 2009 it was designated as the Texas State Amphibian, its range also extends northward to Oklahoma, westward to New Mexico and southward to northern Mexico. It is a desert species and is found in dry grassland, savannahs with scattered mesquite and open woodland, usually on sandy or frequently inundated soils.

Description
Males measure 52–78 mm (2.0–3.1 in) and females 54–91 mm (2.1–3.6 in) in snout–vent length.

Ecology
The Texas toad feeds on insects such as beetles, ants and bugs. It digs a burrow in soft soil and can bury itself in mud. It sometimes conceals itself in a gopher burrow, under a log or in a deep crack in the mud to prevent desiccation, spending much of its time dormant in prolonged dry weather.Breeding occurs after heavy rains when male frogs congregate at temporary pools, ditches, cattle tanks and other wet places and call continuously, especially at night. The call is described as being a ""series of explosive trills"", each lasting for about one and a half seconds with intervals of one second.

Description
Pallas's squirrel is a medium-sized tree squirrel, with a head-body length of 16 to 28 cm (6.3 to 11.0 in), and a tail 11 to 26 cm (4.3 to 10.2 in) in length. Both sexes are of similar size and appearance, and weigh between 310 and 460 g (11 and 16 oz). The colour of the pelt varies considerably between the many different subspecies, but is generally brownish on the upper body with a more reddish tint on the belly, and often with some black on the tail. The precise pattern and shades of the fur are often used to distinguish subspecies from one another, but make it difficult to distinguish the species as a whole from other, similarly variable, tree squirrel species.

Subspecies
Over 30 subspecies have been identified, although not all are recognised by all authorities:

Distribution and habitat
Pallas's squirrel is found throughout much of southeastern Asia, including far eastern India, Bhutan, northern and eastern Myanmar, Vietnam, parts of Cambodia and Laos, much of Thailand, northern peninsular Malaysia, Taiwan, and southern and eastern China, including Hainan .

It was named in honour of the Scottish naturalist and traveller George Finlayson.
It has numerous subspecies that vary greatly in appearance. One of these, C. f. bocourti (syn.

Its taxonomic classification is debated as indicated by the variety of scientific names presently applied in different publications. It is variously considered a form of domestic dog not warranting recognition as a subspecies, a subspecies of dog or wolf, or a full species in its own right.
The dingo is a medium-sized canine that possesses a lean, hardy body adapted for speed, agility, and stamina. The dingo's three main coat colourations are light ginger or tan, black and tan, or creamy white. The skull is wedge-shaped and appears large in proportion to the body. The dingo is closely related to the New Guinea singing dog: their lineage split early from the lineage that led to today's domestic dogs, and can be traced back through the Maritime Southeast Asia to Asia. The oldest remains of dingoes in Australia are around 3,500 years old.
A dingo pack usually consists of a mated pair, their offspring from the current year, and sometimes offspring from the previous year.

Etymology, synonyms, and usage
The name ""dingo"" comes from the Dharug language used by the Indigenous Australians of the Sydney area.

It is a medium-sized cyprinid, and does not exceed a weight of 3 kilograms (6.6 lb) and a length of 45 centimetres (18 in). They are usually silver, although other color variations exist. They are omnivorous and feed on plankton, invertebrates, plant material and detritus. Originally from Siberia or central Europe, they have been introduced to and are now inhabiting lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers throughout Europe, North America, and Asia.Prussian carps are highly invasive fish species in areas outside its native range. They reproduce and spread rapidly. In 2020, scientists demonstrated that a small proportion of fertilized Prussian carp eggs ingested by waterfowl survive passing through the digestive tract and hatch after being retrieved from the feces.  Birds exhibit strong preference for fish eggs, while cyprinids produce hundreds of thousands of eggs at a single spawning event. These data indicate that despite the low proportion of eggs surviving the digestive tract of birds, endozoochory might provide a potentially overlooked dispersal mechanism of Prussian carps. If proven under natural circumstances, endozoochorous dispersal of invasive fish could be a strong conservation concern for freshwater biodiversity.

It is native to North America from the northern United States to the top of the continent.  It is also found in Russia in rivers of eastern Siberia, and this one of only two species of sucker native to Asia (the other is the Chinese Myxocyprinus asiaticus).

Description
The body of the longnose sucker is long and round with dark olive or grey sides and top and a light underside.  They are up to 64 cm (25 in) in total length and weigh up to 3.3 kg (7.3 lb).Longnose suckers are easily confused with white suckers (Catostomus commersoni), which appear very similar. However, longnose suckers can be distinguished by their comparatively finer scales.The longnose sucker is distinctive for its physical characteristics.
First, the longnose sucker, as the name suggests, has an elongated snout which helps to distinguish the species from other suckers. The elongated snout can be 1/3 of the total body length. The longnose sucker has a circular suction disc (large lips) on the ventral side, located near the mouth. These large lips are an adaptation that allows the longnose sucker to attach itself to rocks and other substrate types in a fast-moving environment. The longnose sucker also has large and prominent scales that cover the body. These large scales provide protection from potential predators.

The fish is commonly known as a ""sucker"" due to its fleshy, papillose lips that suck up organic matter and aufwuchs from the bottom of rivers and streams.
Other common names for the white sucker include bay fish, brook sucker, common sucker, and mullet. The white sucker is often confused with the longnose sucker (C. catostomus), because they look very similar.

Etymology
The specific name, commersonii, is in honor of French naturalist Philibert Commerson.

Description
The white sucker is a long, round-bodied fish with a dark green, grey, copper, brown, or black back and sides and a light underbelly. The fish also has typical features of primitive Cypriniformes fishes, such as a homocercal tail, cycloid scales, and dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fin rays. When full grown, it can reach lengths of 12–20 in (30–51 cm) and weigh 2–6 lb (0.91–2.72 kg). The fish's suckermouth, with its fleshy lips, is located in an inferior position at the bottom of its head, as the fish obtains its food from bottom surfaces. The white sucker is often mistaken for different species of suckers and redhorses, but can be distinguished by the complete lateral line system containing 55-85 small scales. The white sucker is able to use chemosensory to sense and avoid predators and other co"

Other names by which this grass is known include dhaman grass, anjan grass, koluk katai and buffelgrass.

Description
African foxtail grass is a perennial grass growing to 20 to 120 cm (10 to 50 in) tall. The leaves are linear, 3 to 25 cm (1 to 10 in) long and 4 to 10 mm (0.16 to 0.39 in) wide. The flowers are produced in a panicle 2 to 14 cm (0.8 to 5.5 in) long and 1 to 2.6 cm (0.4 to 1.0 in) wide.

Distribution
African foxtail grass is native to tropical Africa, the Mediterranean region and the hotter and drier parts of Asia. It is a deep-rooted grass, tolerates drought, and will grow at altitudes of up to 2,000 m (6,600 ft). It is considered a good forage grass in Africa. It prefers light soils with a high phosphorus content. It is also sown in Queensland, Australia and elsewhere for grazing, hay and silage. It was introduced to the Sonoran Desert for erosion control and to feed livestock. In the Mexican part of the Sonoran Desert, it is still being planted and irrigated for livestock grazing. Cenchrus ciliaris has become naturalised and often an invasive species in Australia, the southwestern United States, Hawaii, Mexico, Central America, South America, and Macaronesia.

Because of its rapid growth and aggressive nature, it is categorised as a noxious weed in some regions. However, it is also a popular garden lawn species in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the southern region of California in the United States, as it is inexpensive and moderately drought-tolerant. In addition, it is useful as pasture for livestock grazing and serves as a food source for many avian species, including the long-tailed widowbird.  The flowering culms are very short and ""hidden"" amongst the leaves, giving this species its specific epithet (clandestinus).

Description and habitat
Cenchrus clandestinus is a rhizomatous grass with matted roots and a grass-like or herbaceous habit. The leaves are green, flattened or upwardly folded along the midrib, 10–150 mm (0.39–5.91 in) long, and 1–5 mm (0.039–0.197 in) wide. The apex of the leaf blade is obtuse.It occurs in sandy soil and reaches a height of between 70 and 150 millimetres (2.8 and 5.9 in). The species favours moist areas and frequently becomes naturalised from introduction as a cultivated alien. Rooted nodes send up bunches of grass blades. It is native to the low-elevation tropics of Kenya and environs, where it grows best in humid heat, such as the wet coastal areas.

It is drought-tolerant, grows fast, reaches 3 feet in height, and has many purple, plumose flower spikes.

Environmental threat
Fountaingrass has been introduced to the Canary Islands, Sicily, Sardinia, southern Spain, Australia, South Africa, Hawaii, the western United States, southern Florida and New Caledonia. It thrives in warmer, drier areas and threatens many native species, with which it competes very effectively as an invasive species. It also tends to increase the risk of intense wildfires, to which it is well adapted, thus posing a further threat to certain native species.In Europe, Fountain grass is included since 2017 in the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern (the Union list). This implies that this species cannot be imported, cultivated, transported, commercialized, planted, or intentionally released into the environment in the whole of the European Union.

It is native to Europe but it is known on other continents as an introduced species and often a noxious weed.
Although the plant is often unwanted by landowners because it is considered a weed by many, it provides a great deal of nectar for pollinators. It was rated in the top five for most nectar production (nectar per unit cover per year) in a UK plants survey.

It forms a tumbleweed, helping to increase the species' reach, and the seeds are also enabled by a feathery pappus.

Description
Centaurea stoebe is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant, and it usually has a stout taproot and pubescent stems when young. It has pale and deeply-lobed leaves covered in fine short hairs. First-year plants produce a basal rosette, alternate, up to 15 centimetres (6 inches) long, deeply divided into lobes. It produces a stem in its second year of growth. Stem leaves are progressively less lobed, getting smaller toward the top. The stem is erect or ascending, slender, hairy and branching, and can grow up to 0.91 metres (3 feet) tall. Protruding from black-tipped sepals, the flower blooms from July to September. The flower head is 10 millimetres (3⁄8 in) wide, with vibrant pink to lavender (or more rarely white) disc flowers around 2 cm (3⁄4 in) long; the corolla of each has five narrow lobes. The fruit is an achene about 6.4 mm (1⁄4 in) long with a short, bristly pappus. These are primarily dispersed by wind, sometimes assisted by the plant's tumbleweed mode.

It is found in northern California, Idaho, Utah and eastern Oregon. Plants are taprooted perennials and may reach a height of 36 inches. Flowers are formed in a slender urn-shaped head (4 to 8 flowers per head). Heads are slightly curved downward and resemble diffuse knapweed (Centaurea diffusa Lam.) on a diet but with rose-purple flowers. The head is made of a cluster of bracts and the tip of the bract is bent out. Seeds are pale brown and may disperse 60 feet when not spread by animals. The bent bract often allows the head to catch a ride on passing animals and is considered the mechanism for long distant dispersal. Older plants may have multiple rosettes on top of the long taproot.  The taproot allows this weed to thrive in dry sites so it maybe more invasive than diffuse knapweed in ultra-dry rangeland."
133,처진점나도나물,,Cerastium nutans</em> Raf.,유입주의 생물,식물,Cerastium nutans,"Notes:
This was a long-time perplexing plant for us. We had heard anecdotal accounts from others about how common it was (“I see it in gravel pits all the time”) and visited a number of sites where it had supposedly been collected but never had any success tracking it down ourselves. What we ended up finding during these explorations was always either Giant Chickweed (Myosoton aquaticum) or Mouse-ear Chickweed (Cerastium fontanum), or in the cases of rock outcrops, it was Short-stalked Chickweed (Cerastium brachypodum). We weren't even sure what to look for, since we later discovered no small number of the photos on the web seem to be mis-identified. We have suspicions that some of the herbarium records for this species may be mis-identified as well. In any case, it is certainly not common, and it was mere chance that we encountered it while exploring a degraded algific talus slope at Forestville Mystery Cave State Park. We recognized it immediately as “something different”.

Nodding Chickweed is distinguished from other Chickweeds in Minnesota by the combination of: glandular-hairy all over especially in the upper plant, lance-oblong to lance-elliptic leaves that are stalkless, the lower leaves up to 2½ inches long and to about ½ inch wide, flower stalks elongating to about 5 times the length of the sepals in fruit (at least twice as long as the mature capsule) and abruptly angled down just below the fruit, flower petals cleft less than half their length, and mature capsules 2 to 3 times as long as the sepals and slightly curved. There are 2 recognized varieties of C. nutans: var. obtectum has a limited range in the southwestern US into Mexico and has long, woolly hairs on stems and leaves; var. nutans, common throughout North America, has only a few woolly hairs around lower leaf nodes.

Nodding Chickweed is larger, more erect and lanky than Mouse-ear Chickweed, which is rarely glandular-hairy, is more densely mat-forming and sprawling, and has much smaller leaves (max ~1 inch long). Giant Chickweed has clasping, heart-shaped leaves on the lower stem, leaves are shorter and proportionately broader (about twice as long as broad), flower petals are cleft nearly to the base, and mature capsules are only about as long as the sepals. Short-stalked Chickweed is about half the size of Nodding Chickweed in most respects, and fruiting stalks are comparatively shorter, only about as long as the mature capsule or shorter, and are often bend downward rather than outward."
134,로키산엘크,,Cervus canadensis nelsoni</em>,유입주의 생물,포유류,Cervus canadensis nelsoni,"The Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus canadensis nelsoni) is a subspecies of elk found in the Rocky Mountains and adjacent ranges of Western North America.

Habitat
The winter ranges are most common in open forests and floodplain marshes in the lower elevations. In the summer it migrates to the subalpine forests and alpine basins. Elk have a diverse habitat range that they can reside in but are most often found in forest and forest edge habitat and in mountain regions they often stay in higher elevations during warmer months and migrate down lower in the winter. They may even come down the mountain and leave the forest into some grassland for part of the day but head back into the timber in the evening.

Effects of climate change
Climate change/warming can keep elk in their higher elevation habitats for longer into the winter than normal. Climate changes such as warming have in some cases even increased the seasonal range of elk in the winter. For example, in Yellowstone the climate warming has kept the snow at a lower level than in the past and has given the elk the ability to populate higher ranges than before. The lack of snow in Yellowstone has also given the elk an advantage over the wolves in their predator prey relationship because wolves rely on deep snow to hunt elk in winter ranges of Yellowstone.

Like the red deer of Ireland, it migrated from continental Europe sometime in the Stone Age. The Scottish red deer is farmed for meat, antlers and hides.[2][3]

Description
This deer is slightly smaller than other Western European red deer, an example of insular dwarfism. In summer, the coat is lighter in colour with a distinct border to the lighter patch on the rump. The rest of the colour is dark reddish brown with a greyer face and neck. The legs are blackish brown. In winter the animal grows long hair on the neck. The brow and the bez tines of the antler are usually close together and at a distance above the burr.

Range
This deer thrives in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland and in parts of England such as Westmorland, Devon, Somerset, Wiltshire and the New Forest. It is also found in County Kerry and County Donegal in Ireland. However, most of the red deer kept in parks in the British Isles are derived from the larger subspecies brought from the European mainland, the Western European red deer (Cervus elaphus elaphus). This subspecies has also escaped from deer parks and has become feral in some areas.

Although mostly found in the north of Scotland, there are reports of deer being spotted in the Borders.

Population
The UK's red deer population doubled in the 50 years leading up to 2018, with more than half of those animals found in Scotland. The rising population has sparked significant debate surrounding management, with proponents of culls citing the damage caused to forests and rare plants. They also pose a risk to drivers, with around 6,000 traffic collisions involving red deer taking place each year. Approximately 100,000 are culled each year, although a 2017 report by MSPs argued that efforts to manage the numbers are not succeeding.[4]

Research by the Forestry Commission in 2014 stated that rising deer populations pose the biggest threat to Scotland's native ancient woodlands.[5]

In November 2019 it was revealed that a 45-year study indicated that climate change had affected the gene pool of the red deer population on Rùm, one of the Inner Hebrides islands, Scotland. Warmer temperatures resulted in deer giving birth on average three days earlier for each decade of the study. The gene which selects for earlier birth has increased in the population because does with the gene have more calves over their lifetime. Dr Timothée Bonnet, of the Australian National University, leader of the study, said they had ""documented evolution in action"".[6]"

It is a member of the Fabaceae (pea) family and is indigenous to the dry volcanic slopes of the Canary Islands, but it is now grown in Australia, New Zealand and many other parts of the world as a fodder crop.

Biology
Tagasaste is an evergreen shrub that has rough yellow-grey bark and velvety hairy young growth. Its leaves are composed of three greyish-green equal-sized leaflets, which are slightly paler on the underside. Its scented, creamy-white flowers form in small clusters in the leaf axils. Its flat pea-like pods are green, ripening to black. The seeds are tiny (45,000/kg), shiny and black. Tagasaste is considered to be a promiscuous legume, compatible with cowpea and Tagasaste 1502 Rhizobium. It will nodulate with a wide range of rhizobia.Tagasaste is suited to sandy, well-drained soils of pH range 4–7. On deep, freely drained soils its roots can extend down to at least 10 metres. Any physical or chemical barrier in the soil that restricts root growth will reduce the productivity and survival of tagasaste. Cultivars from arid sandy areas are very susceptible to root rot fungus on poorly drained soils, specifically Fusarium, Pythium and Rhizoctonia. It will tolerate winter temperatures as low as −9 °C, but cultivars exist that can handle winter temperatures down to minus 15 °C as in Orange, Eastern Australia. Tagasast"

It is also known as the common snakehead, chevron snakehead, or snakehead murrel and generally referred simply as mudfish. It is native to South and Southeast Asia, and has been introduced to some Pacific Islands. Reports from Madagascar and Hawaii are misidentifications of C. maculata.A genetic study published in 2017 indicates that C. striata is a species complex.

Description
It is a bony fish with endoskeleton ribcage, grows up to a meter in length, though because of fishing, this size is rarely found in the wild. It has a widespread range covering southern China, Pakistan, most of India, southern Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and most of Southeast Asia. It has more recently been introduced to the outermost parts of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Mauritius. Reports beginning in the early 20th century that it was introduced into the wild in Hawaii, particularly the island of Oahu, as well as later reports from Madagascar, are the result of misidentifications of C. maculata. The only currently confirmed Hawaiian establishment of C. striata is on a commercial fish farm.  Popular media and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service were perpetuating this apparent mistake as recently as 2002. Early- to mid-20th century reports and texts referring to its introduction in California appear to be the result of a misunderstanding.It is an important food fish in its entire native range, and is of considerable e"

Some authorities consider this and all of the members of the genus Chlorocebus to be a single species, Cercopithecus aethiops. As here defined, the grivet is restricted to Ethiopia, Sudan, Djibouti, and Eritrea. In the southern part of its range, it comes into contact with the closely related vervet monkey (C. pygerythrus) and Bale Mountains vervet (C. djamdjamensis). Hybridization between them is possible, and may present a threat to the vulnerable Bale Mountains vervet. Unlike that species, the grivet is common and rated as least concern by the IUCN.

Physical description
The grivet's facial skin, hands, and feet are black. The face has a white line above the eyes. It has long, white whiskers on the cheeks. The fur on the back has an olive color, while the front is white. The skin on the stomach has a blue tint. The fur has a bristly feel. The approximate head and body length for males is 49 cm (19 in) and 42.6 cm (16.8 in) for females. The length of the tail for males is about 30–50 cm (12–20 in).

The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, but it is known throughout most temperate regions of the world as an introduced species which is usually considered a noxious weed.

Description
It is a thin, spindly plant which reaches a meter in height. It starts from a basal rosette of leaves and branches extensively, often forming a weedy thicket. It produces small dandelionlike flowers with rectangular yellow ray florets. The fruit is an achene about a centimeter long topped with a white pappus. It reproduces by seed but also by cloning itself at the root; tilling of soil and chopping up plants actually help this species disperse by sectioning and distributing root parts.

Distribution
Native
From the Aral Sea area in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in Central Asia, westward through Russia, through Europe, to Portugal; and southward through the Caucasus and Southwest Asia, and west to North Africa.

Introduced
North America, earlier only on the East Coast, but by the 1960s reaching Washington, Oregon, and northern California. Weed in Eastern Australia.

Description
Chromolaena odorata is a rapidly growing perennial herb. It is a multi-stemmed shrub which grows up to 2.5 m (100 inches) tall in open areas. It has soft stems but the base of the shrub is woody. In shady areas it becomes etiolated and behaves as a creeper, growing on other vegetation. It can then become up to 10 m (33 feet) tall. The plant is hairy and glandular and the leaves give off a pungent, aromatic odour when crushed. The leaves are opposite, triangular to elliptical with serrated edges. Leaves are 4–10 cm long by 1–5 cm wide (up to 4 x 2 inches). Leaf petioles are 1–4 cm long. The white to pale pink tubular flowers are in panicles of 10 to 35  flowers that form at the ends of branches. The seeds are achenes and are somewhat hairy. They are mostly spread by the wind, but can also cling to fur, clothes and machinery, enabling long distance dispersal. Seed production is about 80,000 to 90,000 per plant. Seeds "

It is widely aquafarmed and introduced populations exist outside its native range. It reaches a maximum length of 1 m (3.3 ft). This species and Cirrhinus mrigala are considered distinct.

Aquaculture
Mrigal is popular as a food fish and an important aquacultured freshwater species throughout South Asia.  It is widely farmed as a component of a polyculture system of three Indian major carps, along with roho labeo and the catla. The introduced by aquaculture across India started in the early 1940s and in the 1950s and in the 1960s to other Asian countries. The mrigal carp fails to breed naturally in ponds, thus induced breeding is done.The Indian carps are considered as a delicacy compared to other exotic carp species also cultured in Asia, and sell for higher prices. Reported annual aquafarming production numbers of mrigal carp since the early 1990s have varied between 250,000 and 550,000 tonnes, with no clear trend.

This fish needs to be handled carefully when fishing it due to its embedded sting or thorn-like defensive mechanism hidden behind its fins (including the middle ones before the tail fin, similar to the majority of all catfishes).

Taxonomy, distribution, and habitat
The walking catfish is a tropical species native to maritime Southeast Asia. The native range of true Clarias batrachus is confirmed only from the Indonesian island of Java, but three closely related and more widespread species frequently have often been confused with this species. These are C. magur of northeast India and Bangladesh, a likely undescribed species from Indochina, and another likely undescribed species from the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo.[3][4] Both of these undescribed species have been referred to as, Clarias aff. batrachus.[3] At present, the taxonomic position of the Philippines population (called hito or simply ""catfish"" by the locals) is unclear, and it also is unclear whether South Indian populations are C. magur or another species.[4] As a consequence, much information (behavioral, ecological, related to introduced populations, etc.) listed for C. batrachus, may be for the closely related species that have been confused with true C. batrachus.[4] True C. batrachus, C. magur and the two likely undescribed species are all kept in aquaculture.[4]

Walking catfish thrive in stagnant, frequently hypoxic waters,[5] and often are found in muddy ponds, canals, ditches, and similar habitats. The species spends most of its time on, or right above, the bottom, with occasional trips to the surface to gulp air.[5]

Diet
In the wild, this creature is omnivorous; it feeds on smaller fish, molluscs, and other invertebrates, as well as detritus and aquatic weeds. It is a voracious eater that consumes food supplies rapidly, so it is considered harmful when invasive.[6]

As an invasive species
Within Asia, this species has been introduced widely.[3] It has also been introduced outside its native range where it is considered an invasive species. It consumes the food supplies of native fish and preys on their young. It also is regarded as an invasive species because they can destroy fish farms.

In the United States, it is established in Florida.[7] It is reported in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Nevada. The walking catfish was imported to Florida, reportedly from Thailand, in the early 1960s for the aquaculture trade.[5] The first introductions apparently occurred in the mid-1960s when adult fish imported as brood stock escaped, either from a fish farm in northeastern Broward County or from a truck transporting brood fish between Dade and Broward Counties. Additional introductions in Florida, supposedly purposeful releases, were made by fish farmers in the Tampa Bay area, Hillsborough County in late 1967 or early 1968, after the state banned the importation and possession of walking catfish.

Aquarium releases likely are responsible for introductions in other states. Dill and Cordone (1997) reported this species has been sold by tropical fish dealers in California for some time. They also have been spotted occasionally in the Midwest.

In Florida, walking catfish are known to have invaded aquaculture farms, entering ponds where they prey on agricultural fish stocks. In response, fish farmers have had to erect fences to protect ponds. Authorities have also created laws that ban possession of walking catfish.

In 2017, Clarias spp. were recovered from the River Tonge, near Bolton, Northern England.[8]"

Description
Miconia crenata is a densely branching perennial shrub normally growing 0.5–3 m tall, but sometimes growing 5 m tall, depending on habitat.The branchlets are covered in large, stiff, brown or reddish-colored hairs. The simple leaves are oppositely arranged, oval-shaped in outline with a broad base, pointed tips, and almost entire to crenate or finely toothed margins. The leaves are also sparsely covered in hairs above, while more densely hairy beneath; and also have five distinct veins that run in an almost parallel fashion from the leaf bases to their tips.The flowers are arranged in small clusters at the tips of the branches. Each flower has five white, or occasionally pale pinkish, petals and five distinctive stamens that have a claw-like appearance. The base of the flower is swollen into a cup-shaped structure which is moderately to sparsely covered with a mixture of bristly and sticky hairs.The small, rounded fruit are berries and are either dark blue, purplish or blackish in color. Each of these berries contains over 100 light brown colored seeds.

Distribution and habitat
Native from tropical areas in the Americas (Mexico to Paraguay as well as the Caribbean region). This species grows in dry to wet tropical climates up to 1200 m of elevation.

This fish is found widely in fresh and brackish waters in the northern half of Africa and the Middle East. Elsewhere in Africa, Asia, Australia and North America, it has been introduced as a food fish or as a control of aquatic vegetation. Where introduced, it sometimes becomes invasive, threatening the local ecology and species. The redbelly tilapia is an important food fish and sometimes aquacultured.The species was named by Paul Gervais in honor of M.

Native distribution and taxonomy
In Africa, the native range of the redbelly tilapia covers the northern half of the continent. In tropical West to Central Africa, from coastal southern Morocco and the Senegal River to the central Congo River basin, its range is almost continuous. In northeastern Africa the redbelly tilapia occurs throughout much of the Nile basin, from its delta in northern Egypt to Lake Albert in DR Congo–Uganda, as well Lake Turkana in Ethiopia–Kenya; it is not native to the other African Great Lakes, although it has been introduced to some of them.

It is found in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovakia (Štrbské pleso), Russia and Sweden. As of 2013, it has been listed as a vulnerable species by the IUCN and as endangered by HELCOM.
It is an extremely important fish within the Baltic Sea ecosystem, both for population equilibrium and for the local diets of the surrounding human population. Due to a variety of factors, mostly overfishing, the maraena’s population dwindled to near-extinction levels. Thus, rampant repopulation was enacted to preserve this important fish.In the Baltic basin countries, this species has traditionally been known as Coregonus lavaretus (the common whitefish). The name Coregonus maraena has been adopted following the suggestion that the name Coregonus lavaretus should only be applied narrowly to some whitefish populations in France and Switzerland, as advocated by Kottelat and Freyhof, and repeated by the IUCN and FishBase.

166,안데스대왕갈대,"Purple pampas grass, Jubata grass",Cortaderia jubata</em> (Lemoine ex Carrière) Stapf,유입주의 생물,식물,Cortaderia jubata,"Cortaderia jubata is a species of grass known by several common names, including purple pampas grass and Andean pampas grass. It is similar to its more widespread relative, the pampas grass Cortaderia selloana, but it can get quite a bit taller, approaching seven meters in height at maximum.
This grass is native to the northern Andes but it is well-known elsewhere as an invasive species noxious weed. This grass has only pistillate parts, that is, all individuals are female. It reproduces by apomixis, in which embryos develop without fertilization.

Description
This pampas grass, Cortaderia jubata, has long, thin, razor-edged leaves forming a large bunch grass tussock from which the eye-catching inflorescences arise. At the top of a stem several meters in height is an inflorescence of plumelike spikelets. These panicles are pink or purplish when new and they gradually turn cream or white. Each inflorescence is packed full of fruits which develop despite the plant's having never been fertilized. Each plant produces millions of seeds per year. They disperse easily by several methods, including wind, water, and soil transport.

Invasive species
New Zealand
In New Zealand C. jubata is listed on the National Pest Plant Accord prohibiting it from sale, and commercial propagation and distribution.

United States
Cortaderia jubata grows well in the conditions provided by the cool, moist California coast, where it was presumably an introduced species as an attractive ornamental plant. "

Etymology
The common name pampas grass, though strictly referring to C. selloana, is frequently applied to all species in the genus (and sometimes also to species of Erianthus and Saccharum ravennae). The name of the genus is derived from the Argentine Spanish word cortadera, which in turn refers to the sharp serrations on the leaves.[6] Cortaderia jubata and C. rudiuscula produce copious seed asexually.

168,흰가슴까마귀,,Corvus albus</em>,유입주의 생물,조류,Corvus albus,"The pied crow (Corvus albus) is a widely distributed African bird species in the crow genus of the family Corvidae.
Structurally, the pied crow is better thought of as a small crow-sized raven, especially as it can hybridise with the Somali crow (dwarf raven) where their ranges meet in the Horn of Africa. Its behaviour, though, is more typical of the Eurasian carrion crows, and it may be a modern link (along with the Somali crow) between the Eurasian crows and the common raven.

Description
It is about the size of the European carrion crow or a little larger (46–50 cm in length), but has a proportionately larger bill, slightly longer tail and wings, and longer legs. As its name suggests, its glossy black head and neck are interrupted by a large area of white feathering from the shoulders down to the lower breast. The tail, bill, and wings are black, too. The eyes are dark brown. The white plumage of immature birds is often mixed with black. It resembles the white-necked and thick-billed ravens, but has a much smaller bill.

Measurements
Length 46 – 52 cm
Wing 328 to 388 mm (17 unsexed birds)
Weight 520 g

Identification
In southern Africa, its range overlaps with the white-necked raven. The pied crow is slightly smaller and has a white chest and belly with a black, more delicate beak compared to the black chest and belly of the larger white-necked raven, which also has a white-tipped and weightier beak.
It is larger than the black crow.

It is between the jackdaw and the carrion crow in size (40 cm (16 in) in length) but is slimmer than either. The forehead, crown, throat and upper breast are a richly glossed black, whilst the neck and breast are a lighter grey-brown in colour. The wings, tail and legs are black. There are regional variations in the thickness of the bill and the depth of colour in areas of the plumage.

Taxonomy
The nominate race C. s. splendens is found in Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bangladesh and has a grey neck collar. The subspecies C. s. zugmayeri is found in the dry parts of South Asia and Iran and has a very pale neck collar. The subspecies C. s. protegatus is found in southern India, the Maldives (sometimes separated as maledivicus) and Sri Lanka and is darker grey.

It is the largest salamander in North America. A member of the family Cryptobranchidae, the hellbender is the only extant member of the genus Cryptobranchus. Other closely related salamanders in the same family are in the genus Andrias, which contains the Japanese and Chinese giant salamanders. The hellbender, which is much larger than all other salamanders in its geographic range, employs an unusual means of respiration (which involves cutaneous gas exchange through capillaries found in its lateral skin folds), and fills a particular niche—both as a predator and prey—in its ecosystem, which either it or its ancestors have occupied for around 65 million years. The species is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Etymology
The origin of the name ""hellbender"" is unclear. The Missouri Department of Conservation says:

The name 'hellbender' probably comes from the animal's odd look. One theory claims the hellbender was named by settlers who thought ""it was a creature from hell where it's bent on returning."" Another rendition says the undulating skin of a hellbender reminded observers of ""horrible tortures of the infernal regions."" In reality, it's a harmless aquatic salamander.

It grows to a length of about 2 inches.  It occupies the northern part of the eastern United States, as well as the southern half of Canada. Small populations are scattered throughout the Mississippi-Great Lakes basin extending to Colorado, New Mexico, Kentucky, Tennessee, etc., though some of these areas are not native to the species. This small fish inhabits clear, cool streams and lakes. They eat small invertebrates, algae, insect larvae, and occasionally their own eggs. They are also preyed upon by smallmouth bass and northern pike. Feedin time is usually dawn and sunset. The brook stickleback does have active competition mostly from minnows, but feeding times are different, along with diet. Spawning occurs in midsummer. Males secure a territory, build a nest, and mate with females. Males provide protection for the eggs, ward off predators, and usually die later in the season. This is considered an annual species. The nests are built out of aquatic grasses. Though the brook stickleback is not considered a threatened species, deforesting and changing waters are altering ecosystems of the species. Harvesting of trees around riparian environments is having a large effect of the stream ecosystem where the brook stickleback resides.

They are a variety of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) developed through selective breeding. The name ""mirror carp"" originates from their scales' resemblance to mirrors. They can grow in excess of 60 lb (27 kg) – the last few British record fish have all been mirror carp.

Description
Common carp have an even, regular scale pattern, whereas mirrors have irregular, patchy scales that have little to no overlap, making many fish unique and identifiable by sight. As a consequence, most mirror carp in the UK over 40 lb (18 kg) are nicknamed.Leather carp are another variety of common carp that resemble mirror carp, but are permitted a few scales either along the dorsal line or the wrist of the tail.

Genetics
The most striking difference between mirror and common carp is the presence of large mirror-like scales on the former. The mirror-scale phenotype is caused by a genetic mutation present at one of two scale trait loci, denoted by their S and N alleles, respectively. The genotype that produces a mirror scale phenotype is ""ssnn"" (all recessive), while wild-type carp may have either SSnn or Ssnn genotype.: 13–14   The ""S"" locus has been identified as containing the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor receptor Fgfr1A1, which was duplicated during the course of carp evolution and consequently does not typically produce lethal phen"

Distribution
It is native to the Iberian Peninsula, especially frequent in the western half in central and northern interior Portugal and central and northern western Spain. It is better known as an introduced species on other continents, including Australia and North America, where it has become a weed in agricultural land and an invasive species in natural habitats.

Description
Cytisus multiflorus is a shrub growing up to 0.8 metres (2 ft 7 in) or 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) in sprawling height, with a broomlike array of many five-angled flexible branches. Leaves appear mainly on lower branches, each made up of three leaflets. Some leaves grow on the upper branches; these are generally made up of a single leaflet. Each leaflet is under a centimeter long and may be linear to oblong in shape and coated in soft silvery hairs.
The white, pea-like flower is up to a centimeter long and is often marked with a dark pinkish streak near the base. The fruit is a hairy legume pod up to 3 centimetres (1.2 in) long. The pods turn black with age and dehisce explosively to release their four to six seeds away from the parent plant.

This plant is native to the west of the Iberian Peninsula and northwestern Morocco.

Description
This is a tall shrub often exceeding 2 metres (6.6 ft) in height. It is highly branched and sprawling. The sparse leaves are made up of small leaflets about a centimeter long each. The shrub bears yellow legume flowers and the pods are covered in white hairs.
This shrub is similar to its relative, Cytisus scoparius, but it can be distinguished by the paler shade of yellow of its flowers and by the hairy coat on its pods.
The sead of this plant can be spread by ants.

Invasive plant species
It is also known in other parts of the world as an introduced species. It was introduced to California in the 1960s as an erosion-controlling plant, but it 'escaped' and spread to become a major noxious weed, an invasive species colonizing in many habitats there. It is also caused ecological damages in Oregon.

This plant, beyond its native range, causes problems in many ways, including displacement of native species causing ecosystem degradation and loss, removing native plant food sources for wildlife, and a susceptibility to wildfire ignition and spread.

Its ancestors originated in South America, and remained there until the formation of the Isthmus of Panama allowed them to enter North America as part of the Great American Interchange.
The nine-banded armadillo is a solitary, mainly nocturnal animal, found in many kinds of habitats, from mature and secondary rainforests to grassland and dry scrub. It is an insectivore, feeding chiefly on ants, termites, and other small invertebrates. The armadillo can jump 91–120 cm (3–4 ft) straight in the air if sufficiently frightened, making it a particular danger on roads. It is the state small mammal of Texas.

Until 2011, this widely distributed species was known as Deroceras panormitanum, and earlier as Deroceras caruanae or Agriolimax caruanae, but Reise et al. (2011)[2] showed that these names refer to a distinct species of similar external appearance known at that time only from Sicily and Malta. Consequently, although the more widespread species was already well known, it then had to be redescribed under the new name of D. invadens. Genetic evidence has indicated that D. invadens is native in southern Italy, including parts of Sicily, and possibly parts of central Italy. Elsewhere it has been introduced, predominantly within the last 100 years, but its spread has been constrained by cold winter temperatures.

Description
Adults are usually 20–35 mm long.[2] The skin and flesh are watery and fairly transparent.[3] The colour of the skin varies between light greyish-brown to almost black. Close inspection reveals fine dark spotting usually over the whole body; this shows up better in alcohol-preserved specimens.[2] Often, but not always, the respiratory pore is pale and unspotted.[3] The mucus is colourless.


D. invadens preserved in ethanol. Scale = 3 mm
Particularly in North America, some Deroceras laeve grow large enough that they closely resemble D. invadens.[3] A useful clue to distinguish them is the profile of the end of the tail when the animal has been disturbed or is preserved.[3][4] The tail of D. invadens usually slants vertically upward from the sole for a short distance, or even bends backwards. The tail of D. laeve slopes forward above the sole. Also, the tail of D. invadens is longer than the mantle, whereas it is the same length or shorter in D. laeve.[5]


Penis, twisted to reveal the ventral side
Nevertheless, dissection is required to distinguish D. invadens reliably from D. laeve and from various similar Deroceras species occurring in Europe, such as Deroceras sturanyi, the true Deroceras panormitanum, and Deroceras cecconii. Reise et al. (2011)[2] discuss and figure the most critical anatomical characters. In most populations of D. invadens, the proximal penis has two side pockets (the penial caecum and penial lobe); these have roughly equal widths and both have rounded, stout ends. A prominent appending penial gland with 3–7 branches attaches between the caecum and lobe on the dorsal side; these branches are less knobbly in outline than those of D. panormitanum. The penial retractor muscle attaches between the caecum and lobe on the ventral side. The intestinal caecum is either absent or represented merely by a widening of the rectum. Barker (1999)[6] and Sirgel (1973)[7] detail various other aspects of the anatomy. 


Behaviour
5:00
A 5-minute video showing the copulation of Deroceras invadens from the type locality. The penial caecae of both partners evert after 31 s. The penial lobe of one partner everts (partially hidden) after 75 s, and the ""tentacles"" of its penial gland evert after 140 s. These events occur later with the other partner, after 156 s and 196 s.[2]
The mating behaviour of this species has been particularly well studied, partly to provide taxonomic characters.[2][6][61][62] Mating starts when one individual closely follows the flattened tail of the other (precourtship). Typically after some minutes the leader turns back and protrudes its sarcobelum (a tapering finger-like part of the penis), as does its partner shortly afterwards. The partners often form a circle head to tail. Early courtship involves violent biting of the partner, lashing the sarcobelum against the partner, and bursts of tail wagging. This is gradually replaced by more gentle-looking stroking of the sarcobelum across the partner. During courtship, sperm accumulates in the penial caecum.[62] After about 90 minutes the partners orient themselves face-to-face, nibble the base of the partner's raised sarcobelum, and suddenly their penises simultaneously evert. The finger-like penial caecum curves round the back of the partner's sarcobelum, transferring sperm onto it. The penises remain everted for a variable period (typically some minutes) before the penial lobe and then the penial gland also evert. The latter transfers a secretion onto the partner.[62] This is directly followed by retraction of the penis (each partner thereby taking up the transferred sperm) and then separation.

Laboratory experiments suggest that D. invadens shows a diurnal rhythm of active locomotion and feeding at night, then inactivity in or below the litter layer during the day; the rhythm is entrained by light. This feeding cycle is accompanied by regular cytological changes in the organs of digestion.[59]

Deroceras invadens exhibited the highest crawling speed (4.9 millimetres (0.19 in)/s) amongst measurements from 28 species of terrestrial slug and snail.[63]

Deroceras invadens usually avoids areas treated with its parasite Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita, a nematode which is used commercially to control slugs. However, the avoidance is replaced by attraction once the slug is infected, apparently an example of host manipulation. Also, another species of parasitic nematode, Phasmarhabditis neopapillosa, is attractive even to uninfected D. invadens.[64]"

It is one of three extant species of vampire bat, the other two being the hairy-legged and the white-winged vampire bats. The common vampire bat practices hematophagy, mainly feeding on the blood of livestock. The bat usually approaches its prey at night while they are sleeping. It then uses its razor-sharp teeth to cut open the skin of its hosts and lap up their blood with its long tongue.
The species is highly polygynous, and dominant adult males defend groups of females. It is one of the most social of bat species with a number of cooperative behaviors such as social grooming and food sharing. Because it feeds on livestock and is a carrier of rabies, the common vampire bat is considered a pest. Its conservation status is categorized as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) because of ""its wide distribution, presumed large population tolerance of a degree of habitat modification, and because it is unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category.""

Taxonomy
The common vampire bat was first described as Phyllostoma rotundum by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1810. Another description was published in 1826 as a new species Desmodus rufus by Maximilian Wied, in the second volume of his work detailing his explorations in Brazil, erecting a new genus Desmodus.

Native to the Ponto Caspian basin, Dikerogammarus haemobaphes expanded their range in 1955. This expansion began in Lake Balaton, Hungary and then spread into certain rivers and lakes in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. These crustaceans likely broadened their range due to the interconnection of waterways in Europe and the use of transportation vectors such as boats and ships.

Identification
Dikerogammarus haemobaphes have a semi-transparent, white body consisting of a head, thorax, and abdomen. Their body consists of seven segments, each with a pair of pereopods (walking legs). These shrimp are different from other gammarid species as their peduncle, flagellum of antennae, and gnathopods have short bristles rather than long ones. Males average 16 mm in length, but can grow up to 21 mm. Females range between 7-15 mm long.

Habitat preferences
Dikerogammarus haemobaphes have a wide salinity tolerance and are able to live in fresh and brackish water.

It is the only species classified in the monotypic genus Dipogon  which belongs to the subfamily Faboideae.

Description
Dipogon lignosus is climbing woody, herbaceous perennial which becomes woody towards the base. The soft green stems climb over nearby structures, shrubs or trees, and can grow up to 2m tall, extending a long way horizontally if possible. Its leaves are dark to medium green above, paler below and are composed of three diamond shaped leaflets which have a wide set base before tapering to a fine point. Each leaflet has its own stalk. The flowers are typical for the pea family and are pink, mauve, magenta and purple in colour, growing on the tips of new growth stems in short, dense racemes with long peduncles. Flowering occurs throughout spring and summer, i.e. August to January in its native South Africa. The pods are flat and sickle-shaped, each containing four to six seeds, and are formed soon after flowering. In warmer climates this is an evergreen, but it may develop a deciduous habit in areas where are subject to frosts.

Distribution
Dipogon lignosus has a native range that covers the Western Cape and Eastern Cape in South Africa where it prefers milder areas where it is not subjected to frost. It is an invasive weed in Australia and New Zealand  and in some areas control of D. lignosus can be mandated.

Asian common toads breed during the monsoon, and their tadpoles are black. Young toads may be seen in large numbers after monsoon rains finish.

Characteristics
The top of the head has several bony ridges, along the edge of the snout (canthal ridge), in front of the eye (preorbital), above the eye (supraorbital), behind the eye (postorbital), and a short one between the eye and ear (orbitotympanic). The snout is short and blunt, and the space between the eyes is broader than the upper eyelid width. The ear drum or tympanum is very distinct and is at least as wide as two-thirds the diameter of the eye. The first finger is often longer than the second and the toes are at least half webbed. A warty tubercle is found just before the junction of the thigh and shank (subarticular tubercle) and two moderate ones are on the shank (metatarsus). No skin fold occurs along the tarsus. The “knee” (tarsometatarsal articulation) reaches the tympanum or the eye when the hind leg is held parallel along the side of the body. The dorsal side is covered with spiny warts.

Appearance
Adult females have a body length of 11–15 mm (0.43–0.59 in), males 9–10 mm (0.35–0.39 in). They have six eyes, a tawny orange to dark-red cephalothorax and legs, and a shiny (sometimes very shiny) pale beige to yellow-brown abdomen, sometimes dark grey. Notably, they have disproportionately large chelicerae for a spider of this size. Dysdera crocata is difficult to distinguish from the much less common Dysdera erythrina, although this species is not often found near human habitation.

Distribution
Dysdera crocata, which originated in the Mediterranean area, now has a cosmopolitan distribution (see map), ranging from Eurasia to parts of North and South America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.

Behavior
Woodlouse spiders are usually found under logs, rocks, bricks, plant pots and in leaf litter in warm places, often close to woodlice. They have also been found in houses. They spend the day in a silken retreat made to enclose crevices in, generally, partially decayed wood, but sometimes construct tent-like structures in indents of various large rocks. Woodlouse spiders hunt at night and do not spin webs. Rather than spinning their webs at night, they use this time to search warm places for prey. Their"

It is native to most of Europe and western and central Asia and it occurs as an introduced species in north-eastern North America, south-western South America and the South and North Island of New Zealand. The plant root was used in ancient times as a treatment for snake or viper bites. If eaten, the plant is toxic to horses and cattle through the accumulation of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in the liver.

Description
It is a biennial or monocarpic perennial plant growing to 30–80 cm (12–31 in) tall, with rough, hairy, oblanceolate leaves. The flowers start pink and turn vivid blue, and are 15–20 mm (0.59–0.79 in) in a branched spike, with all the stamens protruding. The pollen is blue but the filaments of the stamens remain red, contrasting against the blue flowers. It flowers between May and September in the Northern Hemisphere. The Latin specific epithet vulgare means common.

Distribution
It is native to Europe and temperate Asia. It has been introduced to Chile, New Zealand and North America, where it is naturalised in parts of the continent including northern Michigan, being listed as an invasive species in Washington. It is found in dry, calcareous grassland and heaths, bare and waste places, along railways and roadsides and on coastal cliffs, sand dunes and shingle.

Family
Gramineae (South Australia)
Poaceae (Queensland, New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and the Northern Territory)

Common Names
annual veld grass, annual veldt grass, annual veldgrass, annual veldt-grass, annual veldtgrass, longflowered veld grass, longflowered veldtgrass, oat seed grass, tall ehrharta, veldt grass, veldtgrass

Origin
Native to southern Africa (i.e. south-western Namibia and Cape Province in South Africa).

Naturalised Distribution
Widely naturalised in southern Australia (i.e. in many parts of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, in Tasmania, and in the southern and western parts of Western Australia.

Also sparingly naturalised in south-eastern Queensland and naturalised in south-western USA (i.e. California).

Notes
This short-lived introduced grass is a weed of pastures, grasslands, open woodlands, heathlands, roadsides, disturbed sites, waste areas, lawns, parks, gardens, waterways and coastal environs. It is regarded as an environmental weed throughout south-eastern Australia and in south-western Western Australia. Annual veldtgrass (Ehrharta longiflora) competes with native ground vegetation and can change the fire regime in densely infested areas. It has a rapid growth rate, and is usually one of the first annual grasses to flower, which enhances its invasiveness and competitiveness.

In Victoria it is present in conservation areas (e.g. Dookie Bushland Reserve and Phillip Island Nature Park) and is one of several weed species that are thought to be a threat to the survival of the endangered Euroa guinea-flower (Hibbertia humifusa subsp. erigens). Annual veldtgrass (Ehrharta longiflora) also directly threatens one population of the brittle greenhood orchid (Pterostylis truncata ), which is regarded as being vulnerable in Victoria.

In south-western Western Australia, annual veldtgrass (Ehrharta longiflora) is a common weed of wetlands and waterways, invades sand dunes, and is present in eucalypt woodland communities in the Avon wheatbelt region. It is also present in conservation areas in this state (e.g. Piney Lakes Reserve) and is one of the weed species threatening Irwin's conostylis (Conostylis dielsii subsp. teres ) in the Geraldton region.

Annual veldtgrass (Ehrharta longiflora) is also present in numerous conservation areas in South Australia (e.g. Gilbertson Gully Reserve, Angove Conservation Park, Sturt Gorge Recreation Park, Coorong National Park, Sandy Creek Conservation Park, Lincoln National Park and Cudlee Creek Conservation Park)."

It grazes mainly on grass and aquatic plants. It is the only extant member of the genus Elaphurus. Some experts suggest demoting Elaphurus to a subgenus of Cervus. Based on genetic comparisons, Père David's deer is closely related to Eld's deer.Père David's deer were hunted almost to extinction in their native China by the late 19th century, but a number were taken to zoos in France and Germany and the deer was bred successfully in captivity. In the early 20th century, the British nobleman and politician Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford, acquired a few Père David's deer from the Berlin Zoo and built up a large herd on his estate at Woburn Abbey. In the 1980s, the duke's great-grandson Robin Russell, 14th Duke of Bedford, donated several dozen deer to the Chinese government for reintroducing the species to the wild. As of 2020, the wild population in China was an estimated 2,825 individuals, with a further 7,380 in various nature reserves in China. All Père David's deer alive today descend from Herbrand Russell's original herd.

The species is named for the loud call the males make at night. This sound serves two purposes. ""CO"" serves to repel other males and establish territory while the ""KEE"" serves to attract females. Since the auditory systems of males and females respond preferentially to different notes of the male call, this is an example of a sex difference in a sensory system. The common coquí is a very important aspect of Puerto Rican culture, and it has become an unofficial territorial symbol of Puerto Rico. The frog is also found elsewhere, and is usually considered an invasive species outside Puerto Rico.

Taxonomy
The common coquí was described as a species new to science by Richard Thomas in 1966. It belongs to the genus Eleutherodactylus which in Greek means free toes. This family is also known as the ""robber"" or ""thief"" frogs. This genus contains 185 species, which are found in the Southern United States, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. It is part of the order Anura, which includes all frogs and toads. The scientific name of the common coquí, Eleutherodactylus coqui, was first described by Spanish naturalist José Félix de Arroyo de la Cuesta in 1875 (Arroyo de la Cuesta, 1875).

Description
The greenhouse frog is a very small species, ranging from 17 to 31 mm (0.67 to 1.22 in) in length. These frogs are usually drab or olive-brown in colour, and occur in two forms; one has two broad stripes running longitudinally down the back, and the other is mottled. The undersides of both are a paler colour than the back, and the eyes are red.

Distribution and habitat
The greenhouse frog is native to Cuba and some other islands in the West Indies. It has been introduced to Hawaii and Florida, where it has become common. It has been sporadically found in southern Georgia, southern Alabama and eastern Louisiana. It is an introduced species in Jamaica , Guam and Shenzhen, China. It lives in moist leaf litter, often near human habitations, but is seldom seen because it is nocturnal. It sometimes emerges on warm, rainy days in summer, and in Florida, it has been found hibernating in March under the flaking bark of a wild tamarind (Lysiloma) tree.

Diet
The diet of the greenhouse frog consists of small invertebrates, such as ants, beetles, mites, spiders, and roaches.

Reproduction

Characteristics
The garden dormouse is gray or brown, with a whitish underside. It has black eye markings and large ears. Its hair is short, and its tail has a white tassel at the end. It is typically 10 to 15 cm (3.9 to 5.9 in) in head to body length, with a 8 to 14.5 cm (3.1 to 5.7 in) long tail. It weighs 60 to 140 g (2.1 to 4.9 oz).

Distribution and habitat
In spite of its name, the garden dormouse's main habitat is the forest, though it can also be found in fruit-growing regions. It is particularly common in southern Europe, but its range extends into the north. Garden dormice are often found in the Alps, the Bavarian Forest, and the Ore Mountains.
The species is also present in northern Germany, but that population is apparently not capable of large-scale reproduction. In the Netherlands, it is almost extirpated: in 2007, researchers reported finding only nine animals in two woods in the province of Limburg, where it used to be common. They suggested this is a result of the landscape becoming increasingly monotonous and due to climate change, which they said interrupts hibernation.To draw attention to the limits of the adaptability, the Swiss nature conservation organisation Pro Natura has named the garden dormouse ""Animal of the Year"" in 2022.

It is also found in Eurasia, where it is commonly weedy; it is not known as a weed species in its native range. It is sometimes used as an aquarium plant.

Description
It is similar to its relative E. canadensis except that the leaves taper to an acute point. It has a thin branching stem with whorls of 3-4 (exceptionally, 5) flat leaves at intervals. Some leaves are recurved and twisted, with minute teeth. It bears tiny flowers, the staminate ones abscissing from their stalks and floating away from the plant. It flowers from May until October.

It is considered an important food fish where it occurs, reaching up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in total length and 52.2 kg (115 lb) in weight.This fish spawns in the summer, mainly in streams in places like the mid-Amur, Songhua and Ussuri basins. In the Amur, young are found in the lower sections. They mature after 6 years, and after this time they tend to live in floodplains and winter in the main rivers. They mainly consume smaller fish.From the 1970s to 1990s, the population of yellowcheeks drastically decreased, but in the 2010s the population was observed to increase. The species appears to have disappeared entirely from the Yellow River basin. Major threats are dam construction, pollution, and overfishing. However, little is known about the overall trends of this species. As of 2012 there were no conservation measures in place, and it is unknown if such measures are necessary.

Campd.,유입주의 생물,식물,Emex spinosa,"Rumex spinosus (synonym Emex spinosa), commonly known as devil's thorn, spiny dock, or lesser jack, is an annual herbaceous plant of the Polygonaceae. It originates in the warmer parts of the old world, but now has spread with humans to other places. It is common in disturbed areas, especially in sandy soils. It has shown some weedy behaviour in restricted areas within southern Australia.

Description
The lesser jack tends to grow as a sprawling weed. The leaves are plain in shape, resembling spinach. The flowers of different sexes are clustered separately on the same plant.
The plant produces many seeds with a hard, prickly casing. These are produced both in clusters along the branches and at the base of the stem. The root is thick and succulent. At the end of the plant's life, the root dries up and pulls the seeds at the base of the stem into the ground. The spiny, durable seeds make the plant a nuisance around human habitats, much like the similarly shaped seeds of Tribulus terrestris.

Taxonomy
Rumex spinosus was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. It was transferred to the genus Emex by Francisco Campderá in 1819. However in 2015, Schuster et al. demoted Emex to a subgenus of Rumex, restoring the species to Linnaeus's original genus. a move accepted by Plants of the World Online, among other sources.

Uses
Although bitter, the root and leaves can be eaten.

There are dark bands on its side and nuptial males and females will develop blue specks on their bodies. Its mouth is upturned and its pectoral and tail fins are rounded. It grows to an approximate length of 9.5 cm.

Distribution
The banded sunfish is found in the Atlantic coastal drainages of North America from southern Maine south to central Florida and along the Gulf slope as far west as the Perdido River drainage in Alabama.

Habitat
The banded sunfish is found in small ponds and backwaters of creeks to small and large rivers and boggy brooks over sand or mud in sluggish, acidic, heavily vegetated waters.

Diet
The banded sunfish feeds upon aquatic insects and microcrustacean.

Reproduction
Spawning occurs from April through July. They can spawn when they become one year old. The male will construct a sand or gravel nest where the eggs are laid but does guard the eggs as the eggs are buoyant and float way from the nest.

The common name for this species is the brown rainbow boa. This species is semi-arboreal, spending time both on the ground and climbing trees and shrubs, although they are also known to swim. They are nocturnal and primarily active in the middle of the night. Rainbow boas are known for their attractive iridescent sheen on their scales in the sunlight.

Description
Size and weight:
Epicrates maurus is the smallest of the rainbow boas, reaching lengths of 3 to 5 feet on average, although length varies by subspecies. For example, the most common subspecies in captivity is the Colombian rainbow boa (E. m. colombianus) grows to 5–6 feet long and matures between 4–6 years old. There is a clear sexual dimorphism between male and female, with females being significantly larger in both length and girth.

Adults are 60–70 mm in length, and are distinguished from common toads by a yellow line down the middle of the back and parallel paratoid glands. They have relatively short legs, which gives them a distinctive gait, contrasting with the hopping movement of many other toad species.
Natterjacks have a very loud and distinctive mating call amplified by the single vocal sac found under the chin of the male.

Life history
Natterjacks live for up to 15 years, and feed mainly on insects, especially beetles. At night, they move around open terrain with sparse vegetation, and their tracks can often be seen in loose sand. They move considerable distances each night, enabling the species to colonize new habitats very quickly.

Reproduction
The natterjack toad spawns between the end of April and July, laying strings of eggs in shallow, warm pools. Because the natterjack toad is often present in low numbers, its loud mating calls are important so that the sexes can find each other.
For natterjacks, pools need to have a very slight slope with sparse vegetation on the banks and in the water. As such pools are often temporary, sometimes the tadpoles die when the pools dry out. The natterjack compensates for that risk by mating over an extended period each summer. Thus, in September, the age of the juveniles can vary from one to three months.  Early breeders seldom breed again later in the season,"

Description
Erica lusitanica is a hairy, woody shrub just under 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) in maximum height. It is densely covered in plumes of green, leathery, needle-like evergreen leaves each less than a centimeter long. Flowers appear between the leaves, singly or in small clusters, in winter and spring. Each is a hanging rounded tubular bell of fused light pink-to-white petals. The fruit is a capsule a few millimeters long filled with minuscule seeds small enough to disperse on the wind. A single plant can produce millions of seeds per year.

Cultivation
Erica lusitanica is cultivated as an ornamental plant for gardens. Like others of its kind it is a calcifuge and prefers an open, sunny site in acid soil. It is typically seen in the company of other heathers and mixed conifers. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Various other unofficial trivial names are common pike, Lakes pike, great northern pike, northern (in the U.S. Upper Midwest and in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan), jackfish, jack, slough shark, snake, slimer, slough snake, gator (due to a head similar in shape to that of an alligator), hammer handle, and other such names as ""long head"" or ""pointy nose"". Numerous other names can be found in Field Museum Zool. Leaflet Number 9. Its earlier common name, the luci (now lucy) or luce when fully grown, was used t"

Taxonomy
French naturalist Charles Alexandre Lesueur described the chain pickerel in 1818. Its species name is the Latin word niger ""black"".Nicknames include the ""southern pike"", ""grass pike"", ""jack"", ""jackfish"", ""gunny"" and ""eastern pickerel"". In central Florida the chain pickerel is known locally as ""Gatorfish""

Description
The chain pickerel has a distinctive, dark, chain-like pattern on its greenish sides. There is a vertical dark marking underneath the eye, which helps to distinguish the chain pickerel from redfin pickerel (Esox americanus americanus) and grass pickerel (E. americanus vermiculatus), in which the mark curves posteriorly.  Its body outline resembles that of the northern pike (E. lucius). Unlike northern pike, however, the opercles and cheeks of chain pickerel are entirely scaled.  It may reach up to 78.7 centimetres (31.0 in) long only on rare occasions.  The average size for chain pickerel, however, is 24 in (61 cm) and 3 lb (1 1/2 kg). (The average chain pickerel caught by fishermen is under 2 lb).  It lives around 8 yr. In some places the pickerel is known as a ""gunfish"", ""gunny"" or ""slime dart"", due to its characteristic slime coating.A blue color morph lacking the usual reticulated pattern has been described in a New York population.

It is native to sub-Saharan Africa but has been introduced to many other regions of the world and now has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 10,000,000 km2. It is popular and easy to keep in captivity.

Taxonomy
The common waxbill was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Loxia astrild. The etymology of astrild is uncertain. It may either be from a German or Dutch avicultural term for a waxbill or alternatively it may be a misprint for Estrilda. Linnaeus based his description on the ""Wax Bill"" that had been described and illustrated in 1751 by the English naturalist George Edwards in his A Natural History of Uncommon Birds. Linnaeus specified the locality as ""Canaries, America, Africa"" but this was restricted to Cape Town in South Africa by William Lutley Sclater and Cyril Mackworth-Praed in 1918. This species is now placed in the genus Estrilda that was introduced in 1827 by the English naturalist William John Swainson.There are 15 recognised subspecies:
E. a. kempi Bates, GL, 1930 – Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia
E. a. occidentalis Jardine & Fraser, 1852 – south Mali and Ivory Coast to north DR Congo and Bioko Island

The rosy wolfsnail was introduced into Hawaii in 1955 as a biological control for the invasive African land snail, Lissachatina fulica. This snail is responsible for the extinction of an estimated eight native snail species in Hawaii. This has caused the snail to be added to the IUCN’s top 100 most invasive species.

Description
The rosy wolfsnail lives around 24 months. The snail takes 30–40 days to hatch and is then considered young (before sexual maturity). Sexual maturity begins between 4 and 16 months after hatching.  The snail is relatively fast moving at about 8 mm/s. The snail has a light grey or brown body, with its lower tentacles being long and almost touching the ground. The shell has usual dimensions of 76 mm long and 27.5 mm in diameter. The shape of the shell tapers to a point at both ends (fusiform) with a narrow oval- to crescent-shaped opening and a shortened axis of the spiral shell near the opening (truncated columella). The shell has a brownish pink color. The full-grown adult snail ranges in size from 7–10 cm in length.

Its sister species, the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) is also referred to by these names.
Mosquitofish are small in comparison to many other freshwater fish, with females reaching a maximum length of 7 cm (2.8 in) and males a maximum length of 4 cm (1.6 in). The female can be distinguished from the male by her larger size and a gravid spot at the posterior of her abdomen. The name ""mosquitofish"" was given because the fish eats mosquito larvae, and has been used more than any other fishes for the biological control of mosquitoes. Gambusia typically eat zooplankton, beetles, mayflies, caddisflies, mites, and other invertebrates; mosquito larvae make up only a small portion of their diet.Mosquitofish were introduced directly into ecosystems in many parts of the world as a biocontrol to lower mosquito populations which in turn negatively affected many other species in each distinct bioregion.

Description
The eastern mosquitofish is a small, light-colored fish with semitransparent fins. The females usually have a black stripe near their eye area and light spots can be seen on the caudal and dorsal fins of both sexes. Due to its similar size, shape, and reproductive habits, it can easily be mistaken for a guppy.  Generally, males reach 1.5 in (3.8 cm) and females 2.5 in (6.4 cm). These fish are a livebearer species, and as such, the females are larger and more rounded than the males. Pregnant females are also easily recognizable by their gravid spot; a darker area on their bellies where they hold the fry.
Mosquitofish may have a melanistic color pattern with black spots, resembling a dalmatian. This could result in its being misidentified as another species.

The masked laughingthrush was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae. He placed it with the thrushes in the genus Turdus and coined the binomial name Turdus perspicillatus. The specific epithet perspicillatus is [Neo-Latin|Modern Latin]] meaning ""spectacled"".

The yellow-flowering bush is native to the Mediterranean region, and while it may still be commonly sold in some garden stores, it is considered an invasive plant in most places where it has been introduced. It is a noxious weed on the western coast of the US and in parts of Australia.

Description
G. monspessulana grows to 1–2.5 metres (3+1⁄2–8 feet) tall, with slender green branches. The stems are not ridged or green. The leaves are evergreen, trifoliate with three narrow obovate leaflets, 1–2 centimetres (1⁄2–3⁄4 inch) long. The flowers are yellow, grouped 3–9 together in short racemes. Like other legumes, it develops its seeds within a pod. The pods are 2–3 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄4 in) long, tough and hard, covered all over with hairs, and are transported easily by flowing water and animals. They burst open with force, dispersing the seeds several metres. The plant begins seed production once it reaches a height of approximately 40 cm (16 in), and each plant can live for 10–20 years. One mature plant can produce 10,000 seeds per season.

The peaceful dove is closely related to the zebra dove of south-east Asia and the barred dove of eastern Indonesia. Until recently, the three were classed as a single species, Geopelia striata, known as peaceful dove or zebra dove.

Description
The bird is a relatively small pigeon and varies in length from 19 to 21 centimetres (7.6 to 8.4 inches). The peaceful dove has a pink-grey breast with chequered grey-brown wings. Thin striations of black appear around the neck and nape area and descend down the back.  The eye is greyish-white and a blue-grey ring surrounds the eye that tapers off and joins the beak/cere.  The juveniles are paler and less striated.  They also have a duller eye ring.  The nape is similar to that of the bar-shouldered dove in that the nape feathers are striated but differs in that the bar-shouldered dove does not have striated throat feathers like the peaceful dove. Furthermore, the nape feathers are grey-brown in colour compared to the vivid copper colour seen with bar-shouldered doves.
Calls of the peaceful dove are high-pitched ""doodle-doo"", ""co-co-coo"" and ""croorrr!"".

Behaviour
The peaceful dove is found in pairs, groups and flocks.  They feed off the ground and are found commonly in streets and gardens.  They also are found in scrublands, woodlands, watercourses, railyards and on the edge of rainforests. When not found on the ground feeding, they can be found in tr"

248,북미지도거북,Common map turtle,Graptemys geographica</em>,유입주의 생물,파충류,Graptemys geographica,"The northern map turtle (Graptemys geographica), also known as the common map turtle, is an aquatic turtle in the family Emydidae. It is endemic to North America.

Description
The northern map turtle gets both its common and scientific names from the markings on its carapace, which resemble contour lines on a map or chart. These lines are usually shades of yellow, tan, or orange, and are surrounded by dark borders, with the rest of the carapace being olive or greyish brown. However, the carapace markings tend to fade as the animal matures, and in older individuals are usually only visible when the shell is wet. The carapace has a hydrodynamic appearance and is broad with a moderately low keel. The rear of the carapace is flared and the rear marginals form serrations. The plastron is yellowish and is marked by a central dark blotch (plastral figure) that follows the sutures of the plastral scutes and fades with age so that many adults lack a pattern all together (i.e., the plastron is immaculate). The head, neck, limbs and tail are dark green with thin yellow stripes, and an oval or triangular spot is located behind each eye. Like other map turtles, this species exhibits extreme sexual size dimorphism; males are 10–16 cm (3.9–6.3 in) in carapace length and weigh between 150–400 g (5.3–14.1 oz), while females are 18–27 cm (7.1–10.6 in) in carapace length and weigh around 0.67–2.5 kg (1.5–5.5 lb). Females have a much wider head than males and this is associated with differences "

It is a common pet species. Two subspecies are recognized, including the nominotypical subspecies described here.

Description
Also known as a ""sawback"" turtle, the turtle has a carapace featuring a vertebral row of low spines, and is serrated on the posterior rim. The carapace is olive to brown in color with light yellowish markings with dark borders. The plastron color varies from cream to yellow and is patterned with dark lines along the seams in juveniles. The body color of the false map turtle is grayish brown to blackish and is marked with light brown, yellow, or whitish stripes. The eye can be brown, light yellow, white, or green and is crossed with a dark bar. Narrow hooked marks behind the eye fuse with dorsal lines on the head and neck. Also, small light-colored spots occur below the eye and on the chin.

Geographic range
The false map turtle lives in large streams of the Missouri and Mississippi River systems, ranging from Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, through the Dakotas southward to southwestern Alabama, southern and western Mississippi, and Louisiana. The false map turtle also lives in several other river systems of Southwest Louisiana and East Texas.

Conservation status
In the Midwest, the false map turtle is a species of special interest in Ohio.

Behavior
Map turtles of all kinds are avid baskers, spending many hours during the day in the "
250,러프민물농어,,Gymnocephalus cernua</em>,유입주의 생물,어류,Gymnocephalus cernua,"The ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua), also known as the Eurasian ruffe or pope, is a freshwater fish found in temperate regions of Europe and northern Asia. It has been introduced into the Great Lakes of North America, reportedly with unfortunate results, as it is invasive and is reproducing faster than other species. Its common names are ambiguous – ""ruffe"" may refer to any local member of its genus Gymnocephalus, which as a whole is native to Eurasia.

Description
The ruffe's colors and markings are similar to those of the walleye, an olive-brown to golden-brown color on its back, paler on the sides with yellowish white undersides. The ruffe can reach up to 25 cm (9.8 in) in length, but is usually around half that size. It is a very aggressive fish for its size. The ruffe also has a large, spiny dorsal fin which is likely distasteful to its predators. It also has two fins on top, the front fin has hard and sharp spines, the back fin has soft spines called rays. The most obvious features to recognize a ruffe are the ruffe's large, continuous dorsal fin and its slightly downturned mouth.

Distribution
The species occurs in the basins of the Caspian, Black, Aral, Baltic and North Sea, and is also found in Great Britain, parts of Scandinavia and some regions of the Arctic Ocean basin eastward to the drainage of the Kolyma. It has been introduced to parts of Western Europe (France, northern Italy) and Greece, as well as to the North American Great Lakes.

Although once considered to be three separate species, it is now considered to be one, with nine recognised subspecies. A member of the Artamidae, the Australian magpie is placed in its own genus Gymnorhina and is most closely related to the black butcherbird (Melloria quoyi). It is not closely related to the European magpie, which is a corvid.
The adult Australian magpie is a fairly robust bird ranging from 37 to 43 cm (14.5 to 17 in) in length, with black and white plumage, gold brown eyes and a solid wedge-shaped bluish-white and black bill. The male and female are similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by differences in back markings. The male has pure white feathers on the back of the head where the female has white blending to grey feathers. With its long legs, the Australian magpie walks rather than waddles or hops and spends much time on the ground.
Described as one of Australia's most accomplished songbirds, the Australian magpie has an array of complex vocalisations. It is omnivorous, with the bulk of its varied diet made up of invertebrates. It is generally sedentary and territorial throughout its range. Common and widespread, it has adapted well to human habitation and is a familiar bird of parks, gardens and farmland in Australia and New Guinea. This species is commonly fed by households around Austral"

It is also known as the Northern Rivers funnel-web spider or northern funnel-web spider.

Taxonomy
A member of the genus Hadronyche, the northern tree-dwelling funnel-web spider was first described in 1914, by William Joseph Rainbow in the genus Atrax, having been collected from the vicinity of the Richmond River. Rainbow suspected it may have needed to be placed in a genus separate to Atrax at the time, but demurred due to the lack of male specimens. The species name is derived from the Latin formidabilis ""terrifying"". Within the genus Hadronyche, it is classified in the heterogeneous cerberea group, alongside the southern tree-dwelling funnel-web (H. cerberea), the Blue Mountains funnel-web (H. versuta) and 12 other species from southern New South Wales and Victoria.

Description
The northern tree-dwelling funnel-web spider has a glossy black carapace, and matte black or dark brown chelicerae, legs and abdomen. The dorsolateral surface of the abdomen may have a plum- or purplish tinge. The carapace of both sexes is longer and thinner than other members of the genus Hadronyche. With a body length of 40-50 millimetres, it is the largest member of the funnel-web subfamily Atracinae. The species is very similar to the ground-dwelling Darling Downs funnel-web spider (Hadronyche infensa); the male northern tree-dwelling funn"

Taxonomy
A member of the genus Hadronyche, the Blue Mountains funnel-web spider was first described in 1914, by William Joseph Rainbow in the genus Atrax, having been collected from the vicinity of the Jenolan Caves. The species name is derived from the Latin versutus ""clever/cunning"".

Description
The Blue Mountains funnel-web spider has a similar colouration to most other Australian funnel-web spiders, namely a shiny black carapace and black to dark brown legs and chelicerae. The abdomen of the male has a pale dorsal patch, and that of the female is maroon-brown. The carapace in the male is slightly longer than wide and is roughly square in the female.

Distribution and habitat
The Blue Mountains funnel-web spider is found in eastern Australia from the Blue Mountains to Illawarra District in New South Wales. Its burrows are found in stumps and rotten logs.

Toxicity
One out of nine recorded cases of being bitten by a Blue Mountains funnel-web spider has resulted in severe symptoms of envenomation. The bite can be successfully treated with the antivenom for the related Sydney funnel-web spider (Atrax robustus). Symptoms of envenomation can occur within 15–20 minutes. Applying pressure bandage similar to snake bite treatment can significantly delay the onset of symptoms and remains a critical part of the management of an Australian funnel-web spider bi"

Ledeb.,유입주의 생물,식물,Halogeton glomeratus,"Halogeton glomeratus is a species of flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae known by the common names saltlover, Aral barilla, and halogeton. It is native to Russia, Central Asia and China, but the plant is probably better known in the western United States, where it is an introduced species and a notorious noxious weed. This annual herb is a hardy halophyte, thriving in soils far too saline to support many other plants. It also grows in alkali soils such as those on alkali flats and disturbed, barren habitat. It can be found in sagebrush and shadscale habitat, and it grows well in areas with cold winters.This plant produces a usually erect stem with several curving branches up to about 25 centimeters (10 in) tall. It has a taproot reaching up to half a meter deep in the soil and many lateral roots. The branches are lined with narrow, fleshy, blue-green leaves each up to about 2 centimeters long tipped with stiff bristles. The inflorescences are located all along the stem branches next to the leaves. Each inflorescence is a small cluster of tiny bisexual and female-only flowers accompanied by waxy bracts. The winged, membranous flowers surround the developing fruit, which is all that remains on the plant when it is ripe, the leaves and flower parts having fallen away. The fruit is a pale cylindrical utricle. The plant produces large amounts of seeds, which are dispersed by many vehicles, including human activity, animals (including ants), water flow, wind, and by being c"

Helianthus ciliaris grows in much of the south-central and southwestern United States (from Texas north to Kansas and west to California) and northern Mexico (from Tamaulipas west to Sonora and south to Durango and San Luis Potosí), but it can be found elsewhere in North America where it is an introduced species and often a noxious weed. It is weedy even in much of its native range, growing readily in disturbed areas, on cultivated land, and along the roadside. It grows well in moist areas such as drainage ditches.
Helianthus ciliaris is a perennial herb with distinctive blue-green foliage growing to heights of 40 to 70 centimeters (16-28 inches). It has a tough, horizontally spreading root system which sprouts new plants at distances from the parent, and can also sprout after being fragmented, so plowing the plant under can actually help it spread. The leaves are variable in size, shape, and arrangement, but are generally narrowly lance-shaped and wavy with rough hairs along the edges. The inflorescence holds a mass of at least 35 yellow-tipped red disc florets often surrounded by a fringe of 10-18 curling yellow ray florets, although some heads lack ray florets.

257,아르헨티나해꽃,,Heliotropium amplexicaule</em> Vahl,유입주의 생물,식물,Heliotropium amplexicaule,"Heliotropium amplexicaule is a species of heliotrope known by several common names, including clasping heliotrope, blue heliotrope, and summer heliotrope. It is native to South America, especially Argentina, but it is known on several other continents where it is an introduced species, and in some areas such as eastern Australia, a noxious weed.
This is a clumpy perennial herb growing branching, hairy stems to about half a meter in maximum height. It has abundant foliage of oblong wavy-edged green leaves four to nine centimeters long. The curving terminal spike inflorescences hold several tiny bright purple flowers with rounded lobes and tubular yellow throats. The fruits are paired rough-surfaced nutlets.
Biological pest control is being investigated for reducing the spread of this plant in New South Wales and surrounding areas in Australia. The blue heliotrope leaf beetle, Deuterocampta quadrijuga, has shown promise, as has the flea beetle now called blue heliotrope flea beetle (Longitarsus spp.).

Toxicity
Heliotropium amplexicaule contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids and is poisonous. This plant competes with desirable pastures and causes toxicity to stock.

It is characterized by a globular brown shell. It is an edible species. Helix pomatia commonly occurs synanthropically throughout its range.

Distribution
The present distribution of Helix pomatia is considerably affected by the dispersion of humans and synanthropic occurrences. The northern limits of their natural distribution run presumably through central Germany and southern Poland with the eastern range limits running through western-most Ukraine and Moldova/Romania to Bulgaria. In the south, the species reaches northern Bulgaria, central Serbia, Bosnia and Hezegovina and Croatia. It occurs in northern Italy southwards to the Po and the Ligurian Apennines. Westerly the native range extends to eastern France.Helix pomatia is now distributed up to western Belarus and the Baltic states, the south of Finland, Sweden and Norway, Denmark, northern Germany, and the Benelux. Scattered introduced populations occur westwards up to northern Spain. In Great Britain, it lives on chalk soils in the south and west of England. In the east, it was introduced up to the Volga. Introduced populations also exist in eastern USA and Canada.

It is also currently found in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean, where it has been inadvertently introduced by humans.

Description
This species can attain a maximum length, from snout to vent, of 12.7 cm (5 in). Being nocturnal, it has very large eyes which are useful in spotting prey in low light conditions. It can change color (slowly) from light brown to a darker brown to better match its surroundings.

Diet
Its diet is varied, and includes animals such as isopods, centipedes, spiders, scorpions, cockroaches, beetles, moths, flies, mosquitoes, anoles and other geckos with the most important element being Orthoptera species.

Vocalization
As with many gecko species, it has the ability to vocalize. Its vocalizations range from quiet peeps to rapid short squeaking sounds. They may be heard most easily on a quiet night when they are sitting near an open window.

Habitat
The tropical house gecko can be found predominantly in urban locations.

Behavior
Tropical house geckos are mainly nocturnal and are voracious hunters of nocturnal flying and crawling insects. They have learned to wait near outside wall-mounted lighting fixtures so as to catch the insects that are drawn to the light.

It is commonly referred to as the Turkish gecko as represented in its Latin name and also as the moon lizard because it emerges in the evening.A study in Portugal found H. turcicus to be totally nocturnal, with its highest activity around 02:00. It is insectivorous, rarely exceeds 15 cm (5.9 in) in length, has large, lidless eyes with elliptical pupils, and purple or tan-colored skin with black spots, often with stripes on the tail. Its belly or undersides are somewhat translucent. What impact this gecko has on native wildlife in the regions to which it has been introduced is unknown.In many parts of the world, the range of H. turcicus is increasing, and unlike many other reptiles, it appears to be highly resistant to pesticides. The increase may be explained as a consequence of having few predators in places where it has been introduced, and also of its tendency to take shelter in the cracks and unseen areas of human homes, for example inside walls. Reliance on human habitation has thus contributed to the species' proliferation, similar to rodents. In some Eastern Mediterranean countries such as Turkey and Cyprus, harming H. turcicus is taboo due to its benign nature, and it is often kept as a house pet.

The long-eared hedgehog lives in burrows that it either makes or finds and is distinguished by its long ears. It is considered one of the smallest Middle Eastern hedgehogs. This hedgehog is insectivorous but may also feed on small vertebrates and plants. In captivity they can live for over 7 years.Since the long-eared hedgehog is naturally parasite prone and can carry diseases as bad as plague, it is highly recommended that, if kept as a pet, it should be purchased from a respected dealer. Wild hedgehogs have been found to carry Rhipicephalus sanguineus, the brown dog tick, which can transmit Boutonneuse fever.

Description
The length of the head and body of the long-eared hedgehog is approximately 120–270 mm, and the tail is 10–50 mm long. The skull is about 38–48 mm long. Unlike other species the pterygoids of the skull do not inflate and they do not relay information to the tympanic membrane. The ears of this hedgehog are 30–45 mm longer than the closest spine. They are used for heat radiation in the desert. Long-eared hedgehogs have great senses of hearing and smell that they use to hunt out food and detect predators.

In 2006, it was discovered to have invaded the North American Great Lakes.

Distribution
The species is native to freshwater margins of the Black Sea, the Azov Sea and the eastern Caspian Sea. It has historically occurred in the lower reaches of the Don, Danube, Dnieper and Dniester rivers. In Europe, it has recently spread north west, reaching the Baltic Sea in 1992 and the United Kingdom in 2004. The mysid's spread has been facilitated via its deliberate introduction into reservoirs on the Volga and Dnieper rivers in the 1950s and 1960s to serve as fish food. Despite its spread throughout Europe, it is considered to be endangered in some parts of its indigenous range (Ukraine).
The species has entered the Great Lakes via the ballast water exchange; it was reported for the first time in 2006 from two disjunct regions: southeastern Lake Ontario at Nine Mile Point near Oswego, New York in May 2006, and from a channel connecting Muskegon Lake to Lake Michigan in November 2006. Specimens resembling H. anomala have also been found in the stomach contents of a white perch collected near Port Dover, Lake Erie in August 2006. The species was discovered in the Saint Lawrence River in July 2008; it is now found in all the major Great Lakes waterbodies, except for Lake Superior.

It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, as the population is declining due to hunting and habitat loss.A recent phylogenetic analysis indicates that the genus Hemitragus is monospecific, and that the Himalayan tahr is a wild goat.The Himalayan tahr has been introduced to Argentina, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States.

Taxonomy
Tahr belong to the subfamily Caprinae in the order Artiodactyla. Their closest relatives in the subfamily Caprinae are sheep and goats.
A subspecies, the Eastern Himalayan tahr or shapi, was described in 1944. This classification is not considered valid anymore, and no subspecies are currently recognized.

Etymology
The word ""tahr,"" first used in English writings in 1835, is derived from the animal's local name in the Western Himalayas, which has otherwise been rendered as ""tehr,"" ""tare"" and ""tahir"". Through confusion with thār, a Nepali word for the Himalayan serow, it has also been spelled ""thar.""The genus name Hemitragus is derived from the Greek words hēmi- meaning ""half"" and trágos meaning ""goat"".

Sosnowsky's hogweed is now a common weed in the Baltic States, Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, and Poland.
Early botanists considered H. sosnowskyi to be a subspecies of H. mantegazzianum. Sosnowski's hogweed was described as a separate species by Ida P. Mandenova in 1944. The species is named in honor of the Russian botanist Dmitrii Ivanovich Sosnowsky (1885–1952), who found the species in Georgia in 1936.

Description
Heracleum sosnowskyi is 3–5 m (9.8–16 ft) in height, with a straight, firm stem that can reach a diameter of 12 cm (4.7 in). The leaves are 50–60 cm (20–24 in) long. The root is very firm, up to 30 cm (12 in) diameter. The inflorescence is a big umbel found at the end of every stem. It blooms during July through September and produces thousands of seeds. They are easily distributed by the wind, but especially by the water.
Sosnowsky's hogweed is a monocarpic perennial, that is, after a mature plant flowers and produces seed, the entire plant including the root will die.

P.Beauv.,유입주의 생물,식물,Heteropogon contortus,"Heteropogon contortus is a tropical, perennial tussock grass with a native distribution encompassing Southern Africa, southern Asia, Northern Australia, Oceania, and southwestern North America. The species has also become a naturalised weed in tropical and subtropical regions in the Americas and East Asia. The plant grows to 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) in height and is favoured in most environments by frequent burning. The plants develop characteristic dark seeds with a single long awn at one end and a sharp spike at the other. The awn becomes twisted when dry and straightens when moistened, and in combination with the spike is capable of drilling the seed into the soil.
The species is known by many common names, including black speargrass, tanglehead, steekgras (in Afrikaans) and pili (in Hawaiian, ultimately from Proto-Austronesian *pilit₁ ""to adhere/stick""). H. contortus is a valuable pasture species across much of its range. However, it has also been responsible for the elimination of the wool industry over much of Australia due to the seeds becoming embedded in the wool and skin of sheep and devaluing the wool and killing the animals. H. contortus  seeds are also responsible for similar injuries in dogs with thick undercoats, or becoming embedded in the socks and skin of hikers.

Uses
Native Hawaiians used pili to thatch hale (houses). Ruler Pilikaʻaiea was named after the grass, and his royal house was Pili line (Hale o Pili).

The English name six-eyed sand spiders is used for members of the genus, particularly Hexophthalma hahni. 
All Hexophthalma species live in Namibia or South Africa. Species in the genus have dermonecrotic venom, and can potentially cause serious or even life-threatening wounds.

Taxonomy
The genus was first created in 1878 by Friedrich Karsch as Hexomma, with the sole species Hexomma hahni. By 1879, though, Karsch had realized that this name had already been used in 1877 for a genus of harvestmen, so he published the replacement name Hexophthalma. In 1893, Eugène Simon transferred Hexophthalma hahni to the genus Sicarius, and Hexophthalma fell out of use, until a phylogenetic study in 2017 showed that the African species of Sicarius, including Sicarius hahni, were distinct, and revived the genus Hexophthalma for them.Hexophthalma is one of three genera in the family Sicariidae, as of July 2018. It is placed in the same subfamily, Sicariinae, as Sicarius:

During the summer of 2001, a newly recorded species of exotic hawkweed (Hieracium glomeratum Froel.) for North America was identified from specimens collected in southeastern British Columbia, Canada, and eastern Washington state, United States. The specimens had previously been identified as the closely related Hieracium caespitosum Dumort. DNA fingerprints of plants from different localities proved to be identical. Their clonality, along with a spot-like distribution, indicates that this apomictic species probably originated from a single introduction from Europe, which subsequently spread. This species adds to the complex of 14 other exotic Hieracium species belonging to the Eurasian subgenus Pilosella that are adventive in the United States and Canada. A distribution map of the native and adventive range of H. glomeratum, and a key to distinguish it from related species in subgenus Pilosella that occur in North America are provided. The evolutionary and invasive potential of H. glomeratum is also discussed.
Résumé
Pendant l’été 2001, une nouvelle espèce d’épervière exotique (Hieracium glomeratum Froel.) d’origine européenne a été identifiée en Amérique du Nord à partir de deux échantillons récoltés dans le Sud-Est de la Colombie-Britannique, Canada, et dans la partie orientale de l’état de Washington, États-Unis. Les plantes ont d’abord été identifiées comme Hieracium caespitosum Dumort., une espèce très proche de H. glomeratum. Les empreintes génétiques des spécimens récoltés sur les deux sites sont identiques. La clonalité et la distribution restreinte de cette espèce apomictique indiquent qu’elle a été probablement introduite une seule fois d’Europe et s’est répandue rapidement. Cette espèce s’ajoute à un complexe de 14 autres Hieracium exotiques appartenant au sous-genus Pilosella et qui sont naturalisées au Canada et aux États-Unis. Dans cette publication est présentée la distribution de H. glomeratum dans son lieu d’origine (Europe) natale et en Amérique du Nord.

It is found in Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, Laos, Macau, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Its natural habitats are freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, arable land, pasture land, rural gardens, urban areas, ponds, aquaculture ponds, open excavations, irrigated land, seasonally flooded agricultural land, and canals and ditches. They breed in spring to early summer.The domesticated Thai variety and wild Chinese populations of H. rugulosus belong to two separate genetic lineages respectively. Yu et al. (2015) suggest that H. rugulosus may in fact be a cryptic species complex.

Description
H. rugulosus is a large, robust frog, up to 12 centimetres (4+1⁄2 inches) or more in snout-vent length. Females are larger than males. They are primarily insectivores.

Regional names
The Chinese edible frog is commonly referred to as 田雞 (""field chicken"") or 虎皮蛙 (""tiger-skinned frog"") in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, and Chinese communities worldwide. In Filipino, they are called ""palakang bukid,"" which means ""frog of the field.""

A relatively large frog, it is normally green in color, although physiological traits vary between populations. Sexual dimorphism exists between males and females. Outside of its native range, H. tigerinus is a rapidly-spreading invasive species. Both adults and tadpoles can severely damage the populations of other frog species. Typically, Indian bullfrogs dwell in wetland environments. Research has been conducted on their ability to control mosquitos.

Taxonomy
The Indian bullfrog was first described by François-Marie Daudin in 1802, as Rana tigerina. The type locality was given as ""Bengale, India"". In 1992, it was transferred to the genus Hoplobatrachus by Alain Dubois, as Hoplobatrachus tigerinus. In addition to various other renditions and misspellings of R. tigerina, other synonyms include Rana picta, Dicroglossus tigrinus, and Euphlyctis tigerina.

In North America, it is referred to as common frogbit or European frog's-bit to distinguish it from the related American frogbit (Limnobium spongia).
It is a small floating plant resembling a small water lily. It bears small, three-petalled white flowers. The floating leaves are kidney-shaped and grow in rosettes on the water surface, with the roots hanging down into the water column but not normally touching bottom. Frogbit is fast growing and spreads rapidly by stolons, surviving the winter as dormant turions which rest on the bottom, rising again to the surface in spring.
Frogbit is native to Europe and parts of Asia, but it was introduced to Canada in the 1930s and has become invasive in eastern Canada and the northeastern United States, particularly around the Great Lakes. It is considered a pest in this region as it colonises waterways and forms dense masses of vegetation on the surface, threatening native biodiversity, although in its native areas it is rarely dominant.

Origin and invasiveness
Water pennywort is an aquatic plant, native to the Americas. Due to its popularity as a pond plant, and subsequent escape into rivers, it has established as an invasive alien species in parts of Europe, Australia, Africa and Japan. It was one of five aquatic plants which were banned from sale in the UK from April 2014, and was the first prohibition of its kind there. On the other hand, it is in decline in parts of its range in the United States.In Europe, floating pennywort is included since 2016 in the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern (the Union list). This implies that this species cannot be imported, cultivated, transported, commercialized, planted, or intentionally released into the environment in the whole of the European Union.

Description
Water pennywort has stems that spread horizontally and can float on water. Leaves grow on petioles up to 35 cm long, and are round to kidney-shaped, with 3–7 lobes and crenate to entire margins. Flowers are small, pale greenish white to pale yellow, and come in umbels of 5–13. Fruits are small achenes that can float, helping the seeds to disperse.The South American weevil Listronotus elongatus lays eggs on and eats the floating pennywort, and larvae also eat into the stems, reducing the pennywort's ability to grow.

They live from sea level to more than 10,000 feet in many types of habitats, reproducing in aquatic settings. They occur in shades of greens or browns and can change colors over periods of hours and weeks.

Taxonomy
The taxonomy of this frog has a very confusing history. First, the frog was moved from the genus Hyla to the genus Pseudacris in 1986, and Hyliola in 2016 (an elevation of the subgenus which has not been widely accepted). In 2006, Recuero et al. split the frog into three species based on DNA evidence. Recuero et al. used incorrect names for two of the three populations, but subsequent authors established that the correct name (i.e., the oldest available name) for the northern component is Pseudacris regilla, for the central one Pseudacris sierra, and for the southern one Pseudacris hypochondriaca. This revision has been controversial but the evidence is supported by other research (e.g., ), and is followed in this article.

Anatomy and morphology
The Pacific tree frog grows up to two inches from snout to urostyle. The males are usually smaller than the females and have a dark patch on their throats. The dark patch is the vocal sac, which stretches out when the male is calling. Pacific tree frogs can be a number of different colors, i"

The last name, however, commonly refers to the Neotropical tree frogs which make up the subfamily Phyllomedusinae. These are not closely related to H. erythraea, belonging to family Hylidae instead.

Taxonomy and systematics
Long placed in Rana, it is only as closely related to this genus as is e.g. Amolops. Consequently, the genus Hylarana, of which the common green frog is the type species, warrants re-establishment. Hylarana seems to form a clade together with the similarly revalidated genera Pulchrana and Sylvirana, and presumably also Hydrophylax as well as some species presently placed in Pelophylax (e.g. Kokarit Frog, ""P."" lateralis).This frog has confused researchers for a long time, as it resembles tree frogs in habitus.

Biology
Hymenachne is a perennial grass that primarily reproduces via stolons. This robust species is commonly found growing 1-2.5m tall. The stems are hairless and float prostrate across the top of the water, then grow upright from these bases to support leaves. The flat, triangular leaves (10–45 cm long, up to 3 cm wide) have a prominent clasping bases, or auricles. The auricles help to distinguish it from other invasive wetland grasses and the native H. acutigluma in Australia. Hymenachne has been shown to increase the stem length between nodes to keep leaves above water during periods of flooding. Its stem is packed with airy tissue called aerenchyma to help the stems float and to aid in flood tolerability.Hymenachne flowers in the early fall and seeds in late fall.

It is the largest bat in continental Africa, with wingspans approaching 1 m (3.3 ft), and males almost twice as heavy as females. Males and females also greatly differ in appearance, making it the most sexually dimorphic bat species in the world. These differences include several adaptations that help males produce and amplify vocalizations: the males' larynges (vocal cords) are about three times as large as those of females, and they have large resonating chambers on their faces. Females appear more like a typical megabat, with foxlike faces.
The hammer-headed bat is frugivorous, consuming a variety of fruits such as figs, bananas, and mangoes, though a few instances of carnivory have been noted. Females tend to travel a consistent route to find predictable fruits, whereas males travel more to find the highest quality fruit. It forages at night, sleeping during the day in tree roosts. Individuals may roost alone or in small groups. Unlike many other bat species that segregate based on sex, males and females will roost together during the day.

The natural habitats of I. horvathi are temperate forests and shrublands, and rocky areas.

Etymology
The specific name, horvathi is in honor of Hungarian entomologist Géza Horváth.

Conservation status
The geographic range of I. horvathi in central and southern Europe, in mountainous areas of southern Austria, northeastern Italy, western Slovenia, and western Croatia, is fragmented, and believed to be a relict of a much larger range during the last ice age. The small, fragmented range of this species is the main cause of concern for the survival of this species, which is why it is given Near threatened status in the IUCN Red List and is also legally protected in the countries in which it lives.

Native distribution is primarily in the Mississippi River and Louisiana drainage systems, including the Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas Rivers, the Des Moines River in south-central Iowa, the Rio Grande, and south along the Gulf Coast to Belize and Guatemala.An omnivorous predator, it has been introduced in a number of reservoirs and rivers, notably the Santee Cooper lakes of Lake Marion and Lake Moultrie in South Carolina, the James River in Virginia, Powerton Lake in Pekin, Illinois, and Lake Springfield in Springfield, Illinois. It is also found in some lakes in Florida.The blue catfish can tolerate brackish water, and thus can colonize along inland waterways of coastal regions.  It is considered an invasive in some areas, particularly the Chesapeake Bay.

Identification
Blue catfish are often misidentified as channel catfish. Blue catfish are heavy bodied, blueish gray in color, and have a dorsal hump. The best way to tell the difference between a channel catfish and a blue catfish is to count the number of rays on the anal fin. A blue catfish has 30–36 rays, whereas a channel catfish has 25–29. Blue catfish also have barbels, a deeply forked tail, and a protruding upper jaw.

It is a long-lived, stocky fish like its relatives the bigmouth buffalo (I. cyprinellus) and the black buffalo (I. niger), although the smallmouth buffalo's mouth is located ventrally like other Catostomidae species, while the bigmouth buffalo's mouth is terminal and opens forward, and the smallmouth buffalo's eyes are significantly larger than those of the black buffalo. Despite being members of different scientific families, these three species superficially resemble the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), but an easy and notable difference is that all catostomids lack the characteristic barbels of carp.

Physical characteristics
The coloration of smallmouth buffalo ranges from shades of gray to brown and coppery green dorsally and pale yellow to white ventrally. Fin colors match the portion of the body where they attach and are generally darker towards the tips. They are characteristically stocky, having a hump that rises up from the operculum. Pectoral fins protrude ventrally like the anal fins, the caudal fin has even lobes, and the dorsal fin protrudes from the top of the hump to a blunt point, then shortens and runs the remaining length of the body to the base of the tail.

291,큰입북미잉어,Bigmouth buffalo,Ictiobus cyprinellus</em>,유입주의 생물,어류,Ictiobus cyprinellus,"The bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus) is a fish native to North America. It is the largest North American species in the Catostomidae or ""sucker"" family, and is one of the longest-lived and latest-maturing freshwater fishes, capable of living 127 years and reproducing infrequently. Even at a century old they show no age-related declines, but instead improvements relative to younger individuals, making this species a biological marvel. It is commonly called the gourdhead, marblehead, redmouth buffalo, buffalofish, bernard buffalo, roundhead, or brown buffalo. The bigmouth buffalo is not a carp, nor is any other fish in the sucker family. Although they share the same order, each belong to different suborders and are native to separate continents.
The bigmouth buffalo is typically a brownish olive color with dusky fins, but can vary greatly in color across individuals including melanistic, golden, and even xanthic color morphs. Like other catostomids it has a long dorsal fin, but unlike all other extant species it has a terminal (forward-facing) mouth reflecting its unique, pelagic feeding ecology. It is the largest of the buffalofishes and can reach a length of more than 4 ft (1.2 m) and 80 lb (36 kg) in weight. Generally it lives in lakes, or in sluggish areas of large rivers.

At 56 years old for one specimen's age, it is one of the longest-lived catostomids. Found in the Mississippi Basin and southern Great Lakes.  It was first discovered in Canada in the western end of Lake Erie and has been reported from Boston Creek.  The Tennessee distribution ranges from rivers and streams in the Cumberland Mountains, a few rivers in middle Tennessee, and in west Tennessee along the Mississippi River. The ecology of the species is quite similar to that of I. bubalus. I. niger has a ventrally positioned mouth, making the species’ diet benthic-oriented.  It has a distinct shape that mocks I. bubalus and I. cyprinellus, considering it a hybrid between the two species.

Geographic distribution
I. niger is found in large and small rivers in eastern North America from the Mississippi Basin to Canada.  In Canada, the species was first described in Lake Erie.  In the United States, the species is found in both small and large rivers in the basins of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio as well as in southern Lake Michigan and Lake Erie.  Among others, it is native to Iowa, South Dakota and Minnesota; more southern states include eastern Texas and Oklahoma.

Ecology
The ecology of I. niger is most closely related to I. cyprinellus. Due to the ventrally positioned mouth, the diet is benthic-oriented, with the Asiatic clam being the principal food.  De"

Merr.,",유입주의 생물,식물,Ipomoea indica,"Ipomoea indica is a species of flowering plant in the family Convolvulaceae, known by several common names, including blue morning glory, oceanblue morning glory, koali awa, and blue dawn flower. It bears heart-shaped or 3-lobed leaves and purple or blue funnel-shaped flowers 6–8 cm (2–3 in) in diameter, from spring to autumn. The flowers produced by the plant are hermaphroditic. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.The plant is grown as an ornamental for its attractive flowers, but it is invasive in many regions of the world and is specifically listed on New Zealand's Biosecurity Act 1993.

Etymology
The Latin specific epithet indica means from India, or the East Indies or China. In this case, the name likely refers to the West Indies, as I. indica is native to the New World.

Description
Ipomoea indica is a vigorous, long-lived, tender, perennial plant, a vine which is native to tropical, subtropical and warm temperate habitats throughout the world. They can most commonly be found in disturbed forests, forest edges, secondary woodland, suburban gullies, and along roadsides and waterways. The plant climbs well over other plants, walls and slopes as growing on the bottom. Its climbing habit allows it to compete with trees and shrubs successfully. It is a twisting, occasionally lying, herbaceous plant which is more or less densely hairy on the axial parts with backward-looking trichomes. The stems can grow 3 to 6 centimetres (1.2 to 2.4"

It is a twining plant of woodland verges and rough places with heart-shaped leaves and funnel-shaped white flowers with a pinkish throat. The large tuberous roots can be roasted and eaten, or can be used to make a poultice or infusion. When uncooked, the roots have purgative properties.

Description
I. pandurata is a twining and scrambling vine that can reach 30 ft (9 m). The stems are usually hairless and bear alternate, olive-green, cordate leaves, about 6 in (15 cm) long, with long, purple-tinged petioles. The flowers develop in the axils of the leaves in groups of one to five. The sepals are light green and hairless, and overlap one another. The flowers are tubular, white with a pinkish or purplish throat. The corolla is five-lobed, some 2.5 to 3 in (6.4 to 7.6 cm) long and wide. The stamens form a white boss in the middle of the throat. Flowers open overnight and close, on a sunny day, about mid-day, but last longer in cloudy weather. They are followed by capsules containing two to four flat seeds which are noticeably hairy along their outer edges.

Description
The rohu is a large, silver-colored fish of typical cyprinid shape, with a conspicuously arched head. Adults can reach a maximum weight of 45 kg (99 lb) and maximum length of 2 m (6.6 ft), but average around 1⁄2 m (1.6 ft).

Distribution and habitat
The rohu occurs in rivers throughout much of northern and central and eastern India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar, and has been introduced into some of the rivers of Peninsular India and Sri Lanka.

Ecology
The species is an omnivore with specific food preferences at different life stages. During the early stages of its lifecycle, it eats mainly zooplankton, but as it grows, it eats more and more phytoplankton, and as a juvenile or adult is a herbivorous column feeder, eating mainly phytoplankton and submerged vegetation. It has modified, thin hair-like gill rakers, suggesting that it feeds by sieving the water.Rohu reach sexual maturity between two and five years of age. They generally spawn during the monsoon season, keeping to the middle of flooded rivers above tidal reach. The spawning season of rohu generally coincides with the southwest monsoon.

Origin of name
Barramundi is a loanword from an Australian Aboriginal language of the Rockhampton area in Queensland meaning ""large-scaled river fish"". Originally, the name barramundi referred to Scleropages leichardti and Scleropages jardinii.However, the name was appropriated for marketing reasons during the 1980s, a decision that significantly raised the profile of this fish. L. calcarifer is broadly referred to as Asian seabass by the international scientific community, but is sometimes known as Australian seabass or giant sea perch.

Description
The red widow, L. bishopi, has a red-orange cephalothorax, its abdomen is black with yellow rings outlining the rows of red spots and its legs are vermillion red. On its underside, it does not have the familiar hourglass marking and instead usually has one or two small red marks. Females are almost double the size of the male.

VenomL. bishopi has been reported to be venomous like the other Latrodectus members, and although no bites by this spider are recorded in the medical literature, a bite has been captured on video and documented by Youtuber MyWildBackyard on April 15, 2023. The bite resulted in a mildly painful throbbing sensation that lasted several hours. Unlike cosmopolitan species such as the black and brown widows, it seldom comes into contact with humans. The median lethal dose (LD50) of the spider's venom has been measured in mice as 2.20 mg/kg (with a confidence interval of 1.29-3.74), and each spider contains about 0.157 mg.

There are both black and brown button spiders in Southern Africa, that are known elsewhere as widow spiders. Seven Latrodectus species can be found in Southern Africa; six of them are native, one is possibly imported.

Venom
All species of Latrodectus are venomous to humans, and their bite constitutes a medical emergency. Envenomation by these spiders can be fatal to children and ill or infirm adults but there has never been a documented fatality from any button spider species in Southern Africa. Ordinarily, the body mass of a healthy adult is sufficient to dilute the venom to less than a fatal concentration. In most species, only the female spider is capable of effectively delivering the venom to humans as the males have much smaller chelicerae.
Although rarely fatal, the symptoms of the bite are often incredibly painful and medical attention is recommended following any Latrodectus species bite, as complications relating to the bite can arise. Treatment of bites is usually supportive, administering opiates for pain and benzodiazepines for spasms. An antidote is available in South Africa for the bites of both L. indistinctus and L. geometricus, however it is only used for severe cases of envenomation due to its potentially severe side effects. Individuals who are allergic to the venom may also require epinephrine (adrenaline) or diphenhyd"

It is a member of the cosmopolitan genus Latrodectus, the widow spiders. The adult female is easily recognised by her spherical black body with a prominent red stripe on the upper side of her abdomen and an hourglass-shaped red/orange streak on the underside. Females usually have a body length of about 10 millimetres (0.4 in), while the male is much smaller, being only 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) long.
Mainly nocturnal, the female redback lives in an untidy web in a warm sheltered location, commonly near or inside human residences. It preys on insects, spiders and small vertebrates that become ensnared in its web. It kills its prey by injecting a complex venom through its two fangs when it bites, before wrapping them in silk and sucking out the liquefied insides. Often, it first squirts its victim with what resembles 'superglue' from its spinnerets, immobilising the prey by sticking the victim's limbs and appendages to its own body. The redback spider then trusses the victim with silk. Once its prey is restrained, it is bitten repeatedly on the head, body and leg segments and is then hauled back to the redback spider's retreat.

The female's body is 14–16 mm (1/2 in) in length and is black, often with an hourglass-shaped red mark on the lower abdomen. This ""hourglass"" mark can be yellow, and on rare occasions, white. The male of the species is around half this length and generally a tan color with lighter striping on the abdomen. The population was previously described as a subspecies of Latrodectus mactans and it is closely related to the northern species Latrodectus variolus. The species, as with others of the genus, build irregular or ""messy"" webs: unlike the spiral webs or the tunnel-shaped webs of other spiders, the strands of a Latrodectus web have no apparent organization.
Female black widows have potent venom containing a neurotoxin active against a range of mammals (see latrodectism). In humans, symptoms of this venom include pain, nausea, goosebumps, and localized sweating. In historical literature, fatalities were reported at anywhere between 0.5% and 12%, but studies within the past several decades have been unable to confirm any fatalities from this or any of the other U.S. species of Latrodectus (e.g. zero fatalities among 23,409 documented Latrodectus bites from 2000 through 2008).

Like all Latrodectus species, L. indistinctus has a neurotoxic venom. It acts on nerve endings, causing the very unpleasant symptoms of latrodectism when humans are bitten.

Description and behavior
Like all spiders in the genus Latrodectus, females are larger than males.  Females range from 7 to 16 mm, and the males 2.5 to 5 mm.  In maturity, most retain at least short red stripes radiating upward from the tip of the dorsal abdomen.
Like many black widows, it is not aggressive. Its defense method when it feels threatened is to drop to the ground and play dead. Their egg sacks are usually hung in bush vegetation, where prey, which includes insects and arthropods, is available nearby.  Females will occasionally attack to defend their eggs.

Habitat
Its distribution is limited in Namibia and South Africa. Found in habitats such as tangled bushes, uncut grass, tall vegetation in dry places, agricultural areas and forests.

Venom

Red katipō females found in the South Island and the lower half of the North Island, are always black, and their abdomen has a distinctive red stripe bordered in white. In black katipō females found in the upper half of the North Island, this stripe is absent, pale, yellow, or replaced with cream-coloured blotches.

The females are well known for their distinctive black and red coloring and for the fact that they will occasionally eat their mates after reproduction. The species is native to North America. The venom can cause pain and other symptoms, but is rarely fatal to healthy humans.

Taxonomy
Latrodectus mactans was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775, placing it in the genus Aranea. It was transferred to the genus Latrodectus in 1837 by Charles Walckenaer and is currently placed in the family Theridiidae of the order Araneae. The species is closely related to Latrodectus hesperus (western black widow) and Latrodectus variolus (northern black widow). Members of the three species are often confused with the genus Steatoda, the false widows. Prior to 1970, when the current taxonomic divisions for North American black widows were set forth by Kaston, all three varieties were classified as a single species, L. mactans. As a result, there exist numerous references which claim that ""black widow"" (without any geographic modifier) applies to L. mactans alone. Common usage of the term ""black widow"" makes no distinction between the three species.

A common name in English is the white widow spider, and it is known in Russian as белый каракурт, or white steppe spider. It is a member of the genus Latrodectus, which includes species known as widow spiders, which is placed in the family Theridiidae. It occurs both in the steppes of southern Russia, Kazakhstan, and other southwest Asian countries, as well as in the desert regions of the Middle East. Compared to other widow spiders in the region, the white widow spider is comparatively rare.

Description
Unlike most species of widow spider, which are dark in colouration; the white widow spider is, as its name implies, light-coloured, with colouration ranging from beige to white, though with darker legs. The spider lacks the bright red markings found on other widow spiders such as the black widow, the redback spider, or L. tredecimguttatus. Other than colouration, the white widow is similar in appearance to other spiders of the genus.
When it comes to mating, widow spiders are a good example of high investment of males in a single mating. Males generally cohabit with a female for a long period of time, provide energy demanding courtship displays, and at times are cannibalized by the female after mating. Males are generally smaller than females because after they reach maturity, they do not feed and spend most of their lives searching for females.

It is commonly found throughout the Mediterranean region, ranging from southern Iberia to southwest and central Asia, hence the name. Specimens from central Asia are also known by the binomial name Latrodectus lugubris; that name, however, is now considered improper, though it is still commonly found in the literature. Latrodectus tredecimguttatus was previously considered a subspecies of Latrodectus mactans.

Description
L. tredecimguttatus is black in color, similar to most other widow species, and is identified by the thirteen spots which are found on its dorsal abdomen (the species name is Latin for ""with thirteen spots""). These spots are usually red in colour, but may also be yellow or orange. It is otherwise similar to other species in the genus Latrodectus. The Mediterranean widow primarily lives in steppes and other grasslands, and can be a significant problem in areas where grain is harvested by hand. The female of the species has a body length of about 7–15 mm (0.28–0.59 in), while the male is smaller and reaches 4–7 mm (0.16–0.28 in) at best. Only the female spider's bite is dangerous (either for humans or cattle) as the male cannot penetrate the relatively thick epidermis.

Toxicity
Like all Latrodectus species, L. tredecimguttatus has a painful bite that is fatal in rare cases. They are not in close ass"

The population is closely related to the southern black widow, Latrodectus mactans, and the western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus, of the genus.In North America, the species is commonly found in Middle Atlantic states (New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland). During the April–May mating season, it can travel north along the coast as far as Massachusetts. It is also found in Connecticut in the late summer, and rarely, in southern Ontario and southern Quebec, Michigan, and at least as far northwest as parts of Wisconsin.A bite may cause latrodectism, and requires medical attention in the case of increasingly severe discomfort or spreading local redness accompanied by severe pain. Other symptoms, which can last up to a week, may include body aches, severe pain, fever, inflammation, nausea, and vomiting. Bites to humans are not typically deadly except in infants and the elderly. The LD-50 has been measured in mice as 1.20–2.70 mg (0.019–0.042 gr); each spider contains about 0.254 mg (0.0039 gr) of venom.Unlike for the related Latrodectus mactans, as of 2015 no antivenom was available.

The type species of its genus, it is native to the river systems of eastern Canada and the United States.  The redbreast sunfish reaches a maximum recorded length of about 30 centimetres (12 in).
The species prefers vegetated and rocky pools and lake margins for its habitat. Its diet can include insects, snails, and other small invertebrates.  A panfish popular with anglers, the redbreast sunfish is also kept as an aquarium fish by hobbyists.  Redbreast sunfish are usually caught with live bait such as nightcrawlers, crickets, grasshoppers, waxworms, or mealworms. They can also be caught using small lures or flies. Most anglers use light spinning tackle to catch redbreast sunfish. It is popular with fly anglers in the winter because it will more readily strike a moving fly than will bluegills in cooler water.
As is typical for the sunfishes, the female redbreast sunfish lays her eggs (about 1000) in a substrate depression built by the male. The male guards the eggs and fry.
The specific epithet, auritus, is Latin for big-eared.

These fish are widely distributed across the middle and eastern United States, from the Rocky Mountains to the east, from the Great Lakes south into the Gulf Coast. The orangespotted sunfish is ecologically unique and thrives in turbid, shallow systems that have few predators and low oxygen contents. The species prefers vegetated areas in sluggish backwaters or lakes, and can also be found in turbid rivers. The orangespotted sunfish can extend its range in lower-quality waters, which is not characteristic to other sunfish. Orangespotted sunfish vary in total length and age for different river basin originations, but can be found to live four to seven years, and recorded lengths are up to 15 cm (5.9 in).Males make grunting noises to attract females to mate, and are known to nest in ‘colonies’ or aggregations. Spawning patterns are similar to those of other sunfish. Due to the wide distribution of this fish, the species is not endangered and management plans are almost nonexistent presently. The orangespotted sunfish has been introduced to many habitats, such as rivers in Florida, Alabama, Texas, Colorado, Michigan, and Canada.

The longear sunfish reaches a maximum recorded length of about 24 cm (9.4 in), with a maximum recorded weight of 790 g (1.74 lb). Most do not live beyond six years. The longear sunfish is quite colorful, with an olive to rusty-brown back, bright orange belly and blue-green bars on the sides of its head. A unique characteristic is their elongated operculum flap, giving an appearance of a ""long ear"".
The species prefers densely vegetated, shallow waters in lakes, ponds, and sluggish streams. Its diet can include insects, aquatic invertebrates, and small fish. Avoiding strong currents, longear sunfish are usually present in small to moderate flowing streams, rivers, and reservoirs. The genus Lepomis has a well-characterized mating behavior where parental care is done by the male. The male makes and defends the nest, and fans the eggs to remove silt and other debris until the larvae hatch. Some longear females produce 4,000 eggs. They spawn in groups but do not form large colonies.

Since it is a popular sport fish, it has been introduced to bodies of water all over North America. It is known for its diet of mollusks and snails.

Description
The redear sunfish generally resembles the bluegill except for coloration and somewhat larger size. The redear sunfish also has faint vertical bars traveling downwards from its dorsal. It is dark-colored dorsally and yellow-green ventrally. The male has a cherry-red edge on its operculum; females have orange coloration in this area.

Reaching a length around 2 ft (61 cm), and a weight from 3 to 6 lb (1.4 to 2.7 kg), the black-tailed jackrabbit is one of the largest North American hares. Black-tailed jackrabbits occupy mixed shrub-grassland terrains. Their breeding depends on the location; it typically peaks in spring, but may continue all year round in warm climates. Young are born fully furred with eyes open; they are well camouflaged and are mobile within minutes of birth, thus females do not protect or even stay with the young except during nursing. The average litter size is around four, but may be as low as two and as high as seven in warm regions.
The black-tailed jackrabbit does not migrate or hibernate during winter and uses the same habitat of 0.4 to 1.2 mi2 (1–3 km2) year-round. Its diet is composed of various shrubs, small trees, grasses, and forbs. Shrubs generally comprise the bulk of fall and winter diets, while grasses and forbs are used in spring and early summer, but the pattern and plant species vary with climate. The black-tailed jackrabbit is an important prey species for raptors and carnivorous mammals, such as eagles, hawks, owls, coyotes, foxes, and wild cats.

Taxonomy
The Cape hare was one of the many mammal species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae, where it was given the binomial name of Lepus capensis.The taxon is part of a species complex. Lepus tolai and Lepus tibetanus were moved out based on geographic distribution and molecular characteristics. The current remaining grouping of Lepus capensis sensu lato remains paraphyletic.

Description
The Cape hare is a typical hare, with well-developed legs for leaping and running, and large eyes and ears to look for threats from its environment. Usually, a white ring surrounds the eye. It has a fine, soft coat which varies in colour from light brown to reddish to sandy grey. Unusually among mammals, the female is larger than the male, an example of sexual dimorphism.

Distribution and habitat
The Cape  hare inhabits macchia-type vegetation, grassland, bushveld, the Sahara Desert and semi-desert areas. It is also common in parts of the Ethiopian highlands, such as Degua Tembien.

Feeding
The Cape hare is a nocturnal herbivore, feeding on grass and various shrubs. Coprophagy, the consumption of an organism's own fecal material to double the amount of time food spends in the digestive tract, is a common behaviour amongst rabbits and hares. This habit allows the animal to extract the maximum no"
349,유럽토끼,,Lepus europaeus</em>,유입주의 생물,포유류,Lepus europaeus,"The European hare (Lepus europaeus), also known as the brown hare, is a species of hare native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is among the largest hare species and is adapted to temperate, open country. Hares are herbivorous and feed mainly on grasses and herbs, supplementing these with twigs, buds, bark and field crops, particularly in winter. Their natural predators include large birds of prey, canids and felids. They rely on high-speed endurance running to escape predation, having long, powerful limbs and large nostrils.
Generally nocturnal and shy in nature, hares change their behaviour in the spring, when they can be seen in broad daylight chasing one another around in fields. During this spring frenzy, they sometimes strike one another with their paws (""boxing""). This is usually not competition between males, but a female hitting a male, either to show she is not yet ready to mate or to test his determination. The female nests in a depression on the surface of the ground rather than in a burrow and the young are active as soon as they are born. Litters may consist of three or four young and a female can bear three litters a year, with hares living for up to twelve years. The breeding season lasts from January to August.
The European hare is listed as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature because it has a wide range and is moderately abundant. However, populations have been declining in mainland Europe since the 1960s, at least par"

It is currently the only species included in genus Leucaspius, whereas formerly others were included, which now have been moved to Ladigesocypris or Pseudophoxinus or merged with L. delineatus.

Description
The belica is a slender fish with a tapered body which is usually from 4 to 6 cm (1.6 to 2.4 in) long and seldom grows larger than 10 cm (3.9 in). It has an upward-turned mouth and a short lateral line which extends about seven to ten scales from the gill cover. The anal fin is short and consists of eleven to fourteen rays. This is a silvery fish with a particularly intense band of colour running along the flank.

Distribution
The belica is found all over temperate continental Europe and barely extends to Central Asia in the Caucasus region. The southern limits of its range are essentially marked by the Pyrenees and the Alpide belt.
The common name Moderlieschen is of German origin. Although it looks like a proper word that can be approximately translated as ""mouldy Lizzy"", it is actually a bowdlerized version of an older name which survives in parts of Germany as Mutterloseken. Literally meaning ""the little motherless one"", this ultimately refers to the fact that the sticky eggs of the moderlieschen can withstand exposure to air for a remarkably long time. Deposited on water plants, they sometimes stick to the feet of ducks and similar birds and "

Despite its classification and climbing abilities, it does not live in trees and spends almost all of its time close to ground level. It can reach up to 11 cm (4.5 in) in length, making it one of Australia's largest frogs.
Coloured gold and green, the frogs are voracious eaters of insects, but will also eat larger prey, such as worms and mice. They are mainly diurnal, although this is mostly to warm in the sun. They tend to be less active in winter except in warmer or wetter periods, and breed in the warmer months. Males reach maturity after around 9 months, while for the larger females, this does not occur until they are two years old. The frogs can engage in cannibalism, and males frequently attack and injure one another if they infringe on one another's space.
Many populations, particularly in the Sydney region, inhabit areas of infrequent disturbance, such as golf courses, disused industrial land, brick pits, and landfill areas.

The cephalica pars varies from dark orange-brown to reddish-brown, with a '' U '' shape contrasting with the yellowish pars thoracica. The tubers of the eyes are enlarged, while the lateral marens are not dark, the abdomen is grayish or blackened, with the dorsal part darker than the ventral part, the leg segments vary from orange-brown to reddish-brown.

Behavior
It is a very shy spider, with nocturnal habits, building irregular webs under fallen tree trunks and debris, usually in dark places. They can also be found in human environments, in socks, clothes, blankets, wardrobes, garages and among others dark places. Their food, as well as that of several recluse spiders, is based on insects such as cockroaches, crickets and beetles. They have been reported to attack other arthropods such as scorpions. It breeds in the hottest months of the year, laying about 20 eggs taking 46 days for the juveniles to hatch. The female builds a ba"

It is native to the central and eastern United States.This species is an annual herb that reaches up to 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, sometimes growing as a perennial by virtue of its partially woody stem. It has an erect form and a winged stem that is angled. The plant is glabrous.  The linear leaves are alternately arranged. The sessile leaves are decurrent: they extend down along the stem at their bases.  The flower has four yellow petals.  The seed capsules may contain up to 1000 seeds per capsule.This plant grows in wet habitat types, often alongside Polygonum and Cyperus species.L. decurrens has become an invasive species in Africa and in Southeast Asia, where it frequently colonizes rice paddies and other wetlands.  Invasion in anaerobic habitats is facilitated by the aerenchyma that enable willow primrose rhizomes to float and by its capacity to spread either by seed or by vegetative propagation from broken plant fragments. Exudates from this species have been shown to have allelopathic effects on Corchorus olitorius by increasing mortality of seedlings.

Greuter &amp; Burdet,유입주의 생물,식물,Ludwigia grandiflora,"Ludwigia grandiflora, the water primrose, is an aquatic plant of the order Myrtales.It is closely related and easily confused with Ludwigia hexapetala. The two species can be distinguished at a chromosomal level, because L. grandiflora is hexaploid and L. hexapetala is decaploid. However, they can be distinguished morphologically. L. grandiflora has villous hairs, smaller flowers and smaller pollen grains. Some authorities consider that these differences are too slight to consider these different species and so separate these taxa as two varieties or two subspecies.

Invasive species
Ludwigia grandiflora has been listed on the List of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern since 2016 and in the United States it is on the South Carolina State-listed Noxious Weed list. It out-competes other plants by forming dense mats at the margins and in ponds. It is introduced to warm temperate areas of North America, Japan and Europe and has formed large stable populations, particularly in France.

Life history
Ludwigia grandiflora can, and does, produce viable seed, but it is also highly effective at vegetative reproduction and apparently recruitment of new plants from seed is low. The large showy flowers attract a wide variety of insects. A study in Belgium, where L. grandiflora is introduced, showed that the flowers are visited by a wide variety of insects including bees, Lepidoptera, beetles and hoverflies.

Distribution
The species is native to the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces in South Africa, where it tends to occur in sands along the southern coast. It has also been recorded in the Free State, but these may represent introductions. It has been widely introduced in South Africa and elsewhere in Africa, as far north as Morocco.It has become naturalised in Australia and New Zealand. It is listed in Australia's Weed of National Significance list and is a declared noxious weed in the United States.

Description
African boxthorn is a large shrub which grows up to 5 metres (16 ft) high and is covered in spines. The spines are of randomly varying lengths along the branch and, unlike most other species of Lycium (except for Lycium amoenum), they take the form of stout ""peg-thorns"". 
The leaves are oval in shape and are 10–40 millimetres (0.39–1.57 in) long and 4–10 millimetres (0.16–0.39 in) in width.  The broadly obovate or elliptical shape of the leaves can serve to distinguish this species from many other similar species of Lycium, which tend to have narrower leaves.
The solitary flowers emerge from the leaf axils. The corolla is funnel-shaped with large, reflexed, pale purple lobes (petals). The calyx is tubular and encloses most of the corolla (a character shared with Lycium pumilum). This latter character, the calyx that is at least two t"

Description
The colouration of this snake is variable.  

This snake is often confused with the common krait. The presence of a loreal shield can be used to distinguish it from kraits.
The following is a description of various forms from Albert Günther's Reptiles of British India (1864).

Snout broad, much depressed, long, spatulate, with the upper lip swollen, and without canthus rostralis. Rostral shield very low, broad, slightly bent backwards on the upper surface of the snout; anterior frontals [= internasals] very small; posterior frontals [= prefrontals] longer than broad, much more so in adult specimens than in young ones; there is a lateral notch between the anterior and posterior frontals, in which the inner anterior angle of the loreal is received; the posterior frontals have an obtuse lateral angle corresponding to the suture between loreal and praeocular; occipitals elongate. Nostril small, directed upwards, between two nasals, the anterior of which is situated on the foremost part of the snout. Loreal single, large, nearly twice as long as broad.

Although the species is called a cod in the vernacular, it is not related to the Northern Hemisphere marine cod (Gadus) species. The Murray cod is an important part of Australia's vertebrate wildlife—as an apex predator in the Murray-Darling River system—and also significant in Australia's human culture. The Murray cod is the largest exclusively freshwater fish in Australia, and one of the largest in the world. Other common names for Murray cod include cod, greenfish, goodoo, Mary River cod, Murray perch, ponde, pondi and Queensland freshwater cod.The scientific name of Murray cod derives from an early Australian fish researcher with the surname McCulloch and the river from which the explorer Major Mitchell first scientifically described the species, the Peel River.  This was for a number of years changed to M. peelii peelii to differentiate Murray cod from Mary River cod, which were designated as a subspecies of Murray cod. However, as of 2010, Mary River cod have been raised to full species status (M. mariensis), thus Murray cod have reverted simply to M. peelii.Murray cod populations have declined severely since European colonisation of Australia due to a number of causes, including severe overfishing, river regulation, and habitat degradation and are now a listed threatened species.

Habitat Environment
It lives in subtropical forests, savannas, shrublands, and deserts. They prefer grassy areas to places where trees grow high.
Reproduction & Development Method
Fifteen individuals live in groups. Males compete for females during breeding season. Mating is possible throughout the year, but it is most frequent, especially in spring and summer. The gestational cycle is 30-31 days, after which the baby is kept in the pocket for 130-150 days. Females mature sexually at 26-36 months, while males do not mature until 72 months later. Very rarely in the wild, it hybridizes with Eastern grey gangaroo (M. giganteus).
Food habits & food chain
It mainly eats the leaves of herbs, shrubs, and trees at night. In particular, mature males are called stinkers because they have a unique curry smell.

Eastern grey gangaroo (M. giganteus) does not overlap in Tasmania, but it overlaps extensively in the Murray - Darling basin in Australia. However, in the wild, these two species rarely cross each other. Studies in captive populations have shown that mating between two species occurs occasionally between captured animals, but viable magnetic flux is only possible if the mating pair consists of female Eastern grey kangaroo (M. giganteus) and Western grey gangaroo (M. f. fulginosus). Among the offspring, males are normal in extroversion, but do not have sexual reproductive ability and do not mate. Females are reproductive, but can only be reproduced if they are paired with Western grey gangaroo (M. f. fulginosus) males."

About the size of a stout cat, it lives in dense shrub and is only active at night to feed on grasses and small plants. It is the smallest of the wallabies (short, kangaroo-like animals of the genus Notamacropus) and carries its young in a pouch like other marsupials. Shy and elusive, it was believed extinct until rediscovery in the 1960s. It is threatened by habitat loss and is easily killed by non-native foxes.

Taxonomy
The parma wallaby was first described by British naturalist John Gould in about 1840. Its epithet parma (Waterhouse 1845) comes after a word from a New South Wales Aboriginal language, but the exact source word and language have not been identified.In 2019, a reassessment of macropod taxonomy determined that Osphranter and Notamacropus, formerly considered subgenera of Macropus, should be moved to the genus level. This change was accepted by the Australian Faunal Directory in 2020.

Rediscovery and sightings

Habitat Environment
It inhabits coastal and alpine shrubs or evergreen hardwood forests in eastern Australia. It is also found in grazing land.
Reproduction & Development Method
The female's rutting season lasts about 33 days, and during mating, the female licks the male's neck and the male rubs it with his chin. After that, the males and females fight concisely while standing together, and then mate. Continental subspecies mate mainly during the summer of the year, but Tasmanian subspecies breed from December to July. Staying together for a day, the female gives birth to one baby. The gestation period is about 30 days, and the baby stays in the mother's belly pocket for about 280 days and then lives together for about a month. After getting out of the parenting bag, it gradually begins to eat grass and weaves between 12 and 17 months. Males become independent after two years, but females live their entire lives within the mother's sphere of action. Similar to the behavior of some species, such as wolves and elephants, they raise not only babies but also other children.

This species has a characteristic broad yellow stripe extending behind the eye and down the neck; the carapace ranges in color from grayish brown to brown, and the plastron is yellow or orange with black blotches along the outer edges. It is native to  East Asia, ranging from central Vietnam and Laos, north through the coastal provinces of south and central China, with insular populations known from Taiwan, Hainan and the Ryukyu Islands. Although populations in the southern Ryukyus are thought to be native, populations in the northern and central Ryukyus, as well as central Japan, are believed to have been introduced as a result of imports from Taiwan.This species inhabits ponds, creeks, swamps, marshes, and other bodies of shallow, slow-moving water. It is omnivorous, feeding on insects, fish, tadpoles, and vegetable matter such as leaves and seeds. The yellow pond turtle generally remains in or close to water during the day, but may become more active at night and during rainy weather, when it sometimes ventures onto land.One subspecies, M. m. kami, is currently recognized in the southern Ryukyu Islands.

Taxonomy
Previously, this species was a member of the genus Cichlasoma and the subgeneric section Nandopsis. However, the genus Cichlasoma is in revision and has been restricted to the 12 species of South American cichlids related to Cichlasoma bimaculatum. Thus, many of the approximately 100 species that were formerly members of Cichlasoma have yet to be formally assigned to new genera.

Distribution
This species can be found in Middle America. It is native to the Atlantic slope of tropical Mesoamerica, ranging from eastern Mexico southward to Nicaragua. It was first recorded from Everglades National Park, Florida in 1983 and is now a common nonindigenous fish in South Florida.

Habitat
The Mayan cichlid inhabits freshwater marshes, mangrove swamps, lakes, rivers, rocky shorelines, lagoons, estuaries, and coastal islands. Adults prefer coastal lagoons and rivers and may survive in marine conditions. It can be found in oxygen-rich areas near submerged vegetation and over muddy substrates. Despite its preference for waters with dissolved oxygen content of at least 3.5 mg/L, though, it is capable of surviving in extreme hypoxia, because it is an oxygen conformer, becoming much less active in hypoxic water, and even surviving virtual anoxia for up to two hours. Unusually, this fish has been recorded in some cenotes in the Yucatan Peninsula.

It has been introduced in the tropics around the world. It has previously been called Urochloa maxima and Panicum maximum. It was moved to the genus Megathyrsus in 2003.

Description
Megathyrsus maximus grows naturally in open grasslands, usually under or near trees and shrubs and along riverbanks. It can withstand wildfire and drought. The species has broad morphological and agronomic variability, ranging in height from 0.5 to 3.5 m (1.6 to 11.5 ft), with 5–10 cm (2.0–3.9 in) stems. The plant also can reproduce through apomixis, effectively cloning itself through seed. Panicles are open, with as many as 9,000 seeds per plant.

Uses
It can be used as a long-term foraging grass if grazed consistently and if fertilized. It is well suited for cut-and-carry, a practice in which grass is harvested and brought to a ruminant animal in an enclosed system. Shade tolerance makes it suited to coexisting with trees in agroforestry. Some varieties have been used successfully for making silage and hay. The leaves contain good levels of protein, 6-25% depending on age and nitrogen supply.

It grows as a spreading tree up to 20 m (70 ft) tall, with its trunk covered by a white, beige and grey thick papery bark. The grey-green leaves are egg-shaped, and cream or white bottlebrush-like flowers appear from late spring to autumn. It was first formally described in 1797 by the Spanish naturalist Antonio José Cavanilles.
Native to New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and coastal eastern Australia, from Botany Bay in New South Wales northwards into Queensland, M. quinquenervia grows in swamps, on floodplains and near rivers and estuaries, often on silty soil. It has become naturalised in the Everglades in Florida, where it is considered a serious weed by the USDA.

Description
Melaleuca quinquenervia is a small to medium sized, spreading tree which usually grows to a height of 8–15 m (30–50 ft) high and a spread of 5–10 m (20–30 ft) but is sometimes as tall as 25 m (80 ft). Young growth is hairy with long and short, soft hairs. The leaves are arranged alternately and are flat, leathery, lance-shaped to egg-shaped, dull or grey-green, 55–120 mm (2–5 inches) long and 10–31 mm (0.4–1 inch) wide, three to eight times as long as wide.

It is native to Mexico and Central and South America and it has become one of the world's most invasive species.
Miconia trees can flower several times a year and bear fruit simultaneously. The inflorescences are large panicles of white to light pink blossoms. The tiny purple fruits are about half a centimeter in diameter and packed with about 120–230 minuscule seeds. The sweet fruits are attractive to birds and other animals which disperse the seeds. A young tree with only two flower panicles can produce 200,000 seeds in its first fruiting season. This heavy seed production and potential for long-distance dispersal help make miconia an invasive threat. The seeds can lie dormant in the soil of the forest for more than 12 years, and whenever a break in the canopy allows sun to shine through to a patch of soil the seeds there undergo germination. Once the plants grow to full height, their enormous leaves shade out all the space below them, preventing any other plant from growing nearby. It also has a shallow root system that facilitates soil erosion.The tree can grow to a height of 15 metres (49 ft) and has very large leaves, each up to 1 metre (3.3 ft) in length. Its purple and green leaves with flashy white veining made it attractive as an ornamental, and it was imported to Hawaii and other new areas in the mid-twentieth century.

It is the type species of its genus Micropterus (black basses), and is a popular game fish sought by anglers throughout the temperate zones of North America, and has been spread by stocking—as well as illegal introductions—to many cool-water tributaries and lakes in Canada and more so introduced in the United States. The maximum recorded size is approximately 27 inches (69 cm) and 12 pounds (5.4 kg). 
The smallmouth bass is native to the upper and middle Mississippi River basin, the Saint Lawrence River–Great Lakes system, and the Hudson Bay basin. Its common names include smallmouth, bronzeback, brown bass, brownie, smallie, bronze bass, and bareback bass.

Description
Smallmouth have a slender but muscular fusiform body shape making them powerful swimmers. The coloration of the smallmouth bass' ctenoid scales range from golden-olive to dark brown dorsally which fades to a yellowish white ventrally with dark brown vertical bars or blotches along the body and dark brown horizontal bars on the head. The combination of the muscular fusiform body shape and camouflage like coloring make these fish highly effective ambush predators.

It is noted for the rows of dark spots below the lateral line, which give it its common name.  One of the black basses, it is native to the Mississippi River basin and across the Gulf states, from central Texas through the Florida panhandle.  Its native range extends into the western Mid-Atlantic states and it has been introduced into western North Carolina and Virginia.  It has also been introduced to southern Africa, where it has become established in some isolated waters as an invasive species.
Spotted bass can reach an overall length of almost 64 cm (25 in), and can weigh up to 5.2 kg (11 lb).  It can live to an age of at least seven years.  Preferring cool and warm mountain streams and reservoirs with rocky bottoms, the spotted bass feeds on insects, crustaceans, frogs, annelid worms and smaller fish.  It is often mistaken for the similar and more common largemouth bass.  A convenient way to distinguish between a largemouth and a spotted bass is by the size of the mouth.  A spotted bass will resemble a largemouth bass in coloration but will have a smaller mouth.
In 2010, the scientific community officially recognized a separate subspecies of spotted bass, native to the Tallapoosa and Coosa Rivers and their lakes. This species is commonly known as "

History
William Joseph Rainbow described the eastern mouse spider in 1914 from a specimen collected in North Sydney by Henry Houghton Burton Bradley (1845–1918), president of the board of trustees of the Australian Museum at the time. Describing the ""beautiful and strikingly marked"" specimen as a ""decided novelty"", Rainbow named it in honour of its collector, whom he stated was the first collector of Australian spiders.

Description
Eastern mouse spiders are often mistaken for Australian funnel-web spiders. The females are large and very strong, with powerful chelicerae. Their fangs often cross over slightly, while those of Australian funnel-web spiders remain parallel, and the latter often have a drop of venom on their fang tips and have longer spinnerets.
Males have a trapezium-shaped lighter patch that can be coloured from white and pale blue to mauve while females have abdomens that are coloured brown to almost black. Both sexes have a carapace that is a shiny black colour.

Behaviour
The male, which has an all-black carapace and a pale bluish area on top of the abdomen, roams around in autumn and early winter looking for a mate. They sometimes fall into swimming pools when wandering. Cases of envenomations have peaked during this period.The burrow can be found by brushing away loose soil in an "

It is the most widely distributed Missulena species, occurring throughout mainland Australia (but mainly west of the Great Dividing Range). This is possible because the spiderlings disperse via wind (ballooning). Normally this only occurs with araneomorph spiders, mygalomorph spiders normally disperse by walking. Missulena venom may be very toxic, but few cases of serious envenomation have been recorded. Most recorded bites only caused minor effects, with Australian funnel-web spider antivenom having proved effective as a treatment.The spiders dig a burrow up to 55 cm deep, with two trapdoors.
Females are approximately 35 mm long, stout, short-legged, and mostly dark brown to black (but the jaws are sometimes red-tinged). The smaller males are approximately 15 mm long, have longer and thinner legs, and the head and jaws are bright red while the abdomen is gunmetal blue to black.

Habitat Environment
Dry broadleaf forests and humid forests in tropical and subtropical regions are known as major habitats. If you enter Korea, there is a possibility that you may adapt to Jeju and southern regions. Houses are usually built in trees, but they are also found in urban areas. Large populations use palm leaves as shelter. Dragonflies are usually observed on islands, and buildings are also used as dragonflies.
Reproduction & Development Method

It is a permanent resident in the southern parts of its range; northern birds migrate to the southern United States and Mexico in winter, returning to their summer habitat around March or April.

Taxonomy
The brown-headed cowbird was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1775 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in the Carolinas. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-colored plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle, which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name, but in 1783, Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Oriolus ater in his catalogue of the Planches Enluminées. The brown-headed cowbird is now placed in the genus Molothrus that was introduced by  English naturalist William John Swainson in 1832 with the brown-headed cowbird as the type species. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek mōlos meaning ""struggle"" or ""battle"" with thrōskō meaning ""to sire"" or ""to impregnate"". The specific name ater is Latin for ""dull black"". The English name ""cowbird"", first recorded in 1839, refers to this species often being seen near cattle.Three subspecies are recognised:

It is an evergreen shrub or small tree 3–8 metres (9.8–26.2 ft) tall, rarely up to 15 metres (49 ft) tall. The leaves are usually a dark, glossy green, 4–11 centimetres (1.6–4.3 in) long and 1–3 centimetres (0.39–1.18 in) broad, with an entire margin and a bluntly pointed apex. It easily grows in any type of soil.
It is subdioecious, with the male and female flowers produced largely on separate plants, but often with a few flowers of the other sex present (Binggeli 1997). The male flowers have four stamens and are normally produced in clumps close to the branch. The female flowers, usually occurring in similar groups grow slightly farther from the branch tips. The fruit is an edible drupe 5–6 millimetres (0.20–0.24 in) diameter, it is a reddish purple ripening dark purple to black. It is used as an astringent remedy for catarrh (Pérez 1999, Rushforth 1999).

Distribution
In Macaronesian islands it occurs most abundantly at altitudes of 600–900 m. The population in Continental Portugal may be native or naturalised following early importation from Madeira or the Azores (Rushforth 1999). It is an invasive species in Hawaii (Vitousek et al. 1987), where it displaces native trees such as Metrosideros polymorpha, with profound impacts on nitrogen cycling (V"

In some places it is referred to as ""Silver Bass"".The common name ""white perch"" is sometimes applied to the white crappie (Pomoxis annularis).

Description
Generally silvery-white in color, hence the name, depending upon habitat and size specimens have begun to develop a darker shade near the dorsal fin and along the top of the fish. This sometimes earns them the nickname ""black-back"". White perch have been reported up to 49.5 cm (19.5 in) in length and weighing 2.2 kg (4.9 lb).

Ecology
Although favoring brackish waters, it is also found in fresh water and coastal areas from the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario south to the Pee Dee River in South Carolina, and as far east as Nova Scotia. They are also found in the lower Great Lakes, Finger Lakes, Long Island Sound and nearby coastal areas, Hudson and Mohawk River system, Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay. It is also found occasionally in small landlocked lakes and ponds.

Diet
White perch are known to eat the eggs of many species native to the Great Lakes, such as walleye and other true perches. At times, fish eggs are 100% of their diet. They prefer to eat small minnows like mudminnows and fathead minnows.
In the Chesapeake Bay, white perch commonly prey upon grass shrimp, razor clams, and bloodworms which are all common to the region.

It has large, rough scales and two dorsal fins. They are widely distributed across North America, inhabiting large reservoirs and rivers. When mating in the spring, they are more often found in shallow rivers, creeks, and streams. They have been introduced in some places as sport fish and also to predate on nuisance fish, such as gizzard shad. It is the state fish of Oklahoma.

Range
White bass are distributed widely across the United States, especially in the Midwest.  They are very abundant in Pennsylvania and the area around Lake Erie.  Some native ranges of the white bass are the Arkansas River, western Lake Erie, the Detroit River, and Lake Poinsett in South Dakota; they are abundant in the Winnebago lakes system of Wisconsin; and they are also very abundant in Oklahoma.  White bass have also been found in rivers that flow to the Mississippi.

It has also been widely introduced into inland recreational fisheries across the United States.  Striped bass found in the Gulf of Mexico are a separate strain referred to as Gulf Coast striped bass.The striped bass is the state fish of Maryland, Rhode Island, and South Carolina, and the state saltwater (marine) fish of New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and New Hampshire.
The history of the striped bass fishery in North America dates back to the Colonial period. Many written accounts by some of the first European settlers describe the immense abundance of striped bass, along with alewives, traveling and spawning up most rivers in the coastal Northeast.

Morphology and lifespan
The striped bass is a typical member of the family Moronidae in shape, having a streamlined, silvery body marked with longitudinal dark stripes running from behind the gills to the base of the tail. Common mature size is 20 to 40 pounds (9–18 kg). The largest specimen recorded was 124 pounds (56 kg), netted in 1896. Striped bass are believed to live for up to 30 years. The average size in length is 20 to 35 inches (50–90 cm) and approximately 5 to 20 pounds (2–9 kg).

Hybrid striped bass are considered better suited for culture in ponds than either parent species because they are more resilient to extremes of temperature and low dissolved oxygen, although they gravitate toward areas of moving water within impoundments.They became part of aquaculture in the United States in the late 1980s. Most producers purchase the fish young (as fry or fingerlings) and raise them in freshwater ponds. Currently, about 10 million lb (4.5 million kg) are produced annually in the United States. Hybrid striped bass are used both as a gamefish and a food fish.
Hybrid striped bass are produced two different ways. Some of these fish are produced by fertilizing eggs from white bass with sperm from striped bass; the resulting fish are also called ""sunshine bass"" or ""Cherokee bass"". Others are produced by fertilizing eggs from striped bass with sperm from white bass; the resulting fish is called a ""palmetto bass"".
Hybrid striped bass are known for aggressive feeding habits which makes them highly sought-after by anglers.  Often schooling by the thousands, these stocked fish surface feed on baitfish such as shad.  Often called ""breaking"", this surface feeding makes the fish visible and easy to catch on a wide array of lures and baits.

Because of its wide circumpolar distribution, it is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. It is distinct from the long-tailed weasel (Neogale frenata), also known as the ""masked ermine"", or ""big stoat""; the two species are visually similar, especially the black tail tip.
The name ermine () is used for species in the genus Mustela, especially the stoat, in its pure white winter coat, or the fur thereof.Introduced into New Zealand in the late 19th century to control rabbits, the stoat has had a devastating effect on native bird populations. It was nominated as one of the world's top 100 ""worst invaders"".
Ermine fur was used in the 15th century by Catholic monarchs, who sometimes used it as the mozzetta cape. It has long been used on the ceremonial robes of members of the United Kingdom House of Lords. It was also used in capes on images such as the Infant Jesus of Prague.

Etymology
The root word for ""stoat"" is likely either the Dutch word stout (""bold"") or the Gothic word 𐍃𐍄𐌰𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽 (stautan, ""to push""). According to John Guillim, in his Display of Heraldrie, the word ""ermine"" is likely derived from Armenia, the nation where it was thought the species originated, though other authors have linked it to the Norman French from the Teutonic harmin (Anglo-Saxon hearma).

It is of a generally dark brown colour, with a pale underbelly and a dark mask across the face. Occasionally, colour mutations including albinos, leucists, isabellinists, xanthochromists, amelanists and erythrists occur. It has a shorter, more compact body than other Mustela species, a more powerfully built skull and dentition, is less agile, and is well known for having the characteristic ability to secrete a particularly foul-smelling liquid to mark its territory.
It is much less territorial than other mustelids, with animals of the same sex frequently sharing home ranges. Like other mustelids, the European polecat is polygamous, with pregnancy occurring after mating, following induced ovulation. It usually gives birth in early summer to litters consisting of five to 10 kits, which become independent at the age of two to three months. The European polecat feeds on small rodents, birds, amphibians and reptiles. It occasionally cripples its prey by piercing its brain with its teeth and stores it, still living, in its burrow for future consumption.The European polecat originated in Western Europe during the Middle Pleistocene, with its closest living relatives being the steppe polecat, the black-footed ferret and the European mink.

Because of range expansion, the American mink is classed as a least-concern species by the IUCN. The American mink was formerly thought to be the only extant member of the genus Neovison following the extinction of the sea mink (N. macrodon), but recent studies, followed by taxonomic authorities, have reclassified it and the sea mink within the genus Neogale, which also contains a few New World weasel species. The American mink is a carnivore that feeds on rodents, fish, crustaceans, frogs, and birds. In its introduced range in Europe it has been classified as an invasive species linked to declines in European mink, Pyrenean desman, and water vole populations. It is the animal most frequently farmed for its fur, exceeding the silver fox, sable, marten, and skunk in economic importance.

Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and moist savanna.

Anatomy and physiology
The little collared fruit bat was named for its prominent collar of stiff and sticky hairs that line its throat and sides of its neck in adults. On its dorsal side, its fur is dark chestnut brown and long, compared to its ventral surface which is shorter and paler in color. White basal ear tufts and epaulets are absent, helping distinguish the little collared fruit bat from related fruit bat species.

Ecology
Little is known about the ecology of the little collared fruit bat. According to Bergmans (1976), it appears to be a solitary species, spending most of its time in the rainforest zone and near the forest-savanna boundary. The little collared bat tends to fly in the upper strata of the forest, sometimes descending to lower levels where it can be observed. Very few specimens are available in collections, suggesting the rarity of the species.

Description
M. alterniflorum is an aquatic plant that stands approximately 4 feet tall with stems that range from 1-4 feet long. Stems are often submerged in murky or clear water. M. alterniflorum leaves are found both submerged and above water, with leaf location influencing their physical characteristics.  Their leaves have  blade lengths of 3-22 mm with emergent leaves being smaller than those submerged. All leaves exhibit a whorled habit, with 3 or more leaves per node.  Leaves are commonly located at eight nodes along each stem, are typically red and green, and rarely brown.  The flowers on this plant are found above the water, with attached fruit. Each of these fruit that are found in this section are 1.5 mm in length. These fruits then dry and split apart when they are finally ripened. The flowers themselves tend to be more perennial meaning that they bloom three or more growing seasons, and on the smaller side. The flowers bloom in the month of August, which causes them to emerge out of the water.

Description
Myriophyllum heterophyllum is also known in English as either the twoleaf watermilfoil or broadleaf watermilfoil. It is a popular plant in aquariums or garden-ponds.   The species is often misidentified or overlooked due to issues in predictions of infestations and dispersal. It is often mistaken as M. verticillatum in Europe or M. hippuroides, M. laxum or M. pinnatum in North America due to their similar vegetation.

Range
Myriophyllum heterophyllum is endemic to the eastern part of the United States and Canada. In the European Union, the plant has also been found in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Hungary and the Netherlands. Citizen science observations also suggests occurrences in the western-part of the United States and Central America.

The stems of Burma reed, with flower stalks, are from 3 to 15 feet (0.91 to 4.57 m) tall, depending on soil and moisture conditions. The leaves are 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) long and hairless, except for a single line of horizontal hairs at the juncture of the upper and lower portions of the leaf. Stems are approximately 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) wide, round, solid, and have nodes (stem-leaf junctures) every 3 to 5 inches (7.6 to 12.7 cm) along the stem. The flower plumes, which can be up to 3 feet (0.91 m) long, are composed of many hundreds of tiny flowers and have a shimmery, silky appearance. Flowering occurs in April and October in south Florida, each clump producing an average of forty stalks and twelve to twenty flowering plumes. Burma reed resembles several other tall grasses, including common reed (Phragmites communis), giant reed (Arundo donax), pampas grass (Cortaderia selloana) and sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum).

Biology and spread

It is known by the common name tree tobacco. Its leaves are attached to the stalk by petioles (many other Nicotiana species have sessile leaves), and its leaves and stems are neither pubescent nor sticky like Nicotiana tabacum. It resembles Cestrum parqui but differs in the form of leaves and fusion of the outer floral parts. It grows to heights of more than two meters.
Tree tobacco is native to South America but it is now widespread as an introduced species on other continents. It is a common roadside weed in the southwestern United States, and an invasive plant species in California native plant habitats.

It has also been introduced to New Zealand, all the Greater Antilles in the Caribbean (Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico), and some countries in Europe, such as the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Romania and Serbia. In the Americas, it is the most widely distributed wild ungulate.
In North America, the species is widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains as well as in southwestern Arizona and most of Mexico, except Lower California. It is mostly displaced by the black-tailed or mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) from that point west except for mixed deciduous riparian corridors, river valley bottomlands, and lower foothills of the northern Rocky Mountain region from Wyoming west to eastern Washington and eastern Oregon and north to northeastern British Columbia and southern Yukon, including in the Montana valley and foothill grasslands.

As a member of the genus Oncorhynchus, it is one of the Pacific trout, a group that includes the widely distributed rainbow trout. Cutthroat trout are popular gamefish, especially among anglers who enjoy fly fishing. The common name ""cutthroat"" refers to the distinctive red coloration on the underside of the lower jaw. The specific name clarkii was given to honor explorer William Clark, coleader of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.
Cutthroat trout usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large, clear, well-oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms. They reproduce in clear, cold, moderately deep lakes. They are native to the alluvial or freestone streams that are typical tributaries of the rivers of the Pacific Basin, Great Basin and Rocky Mountains. Cutthroat trout spawn in the spring and may inadvertently but naturally hybridize with rainbow trout, producing fertile cutbows. Some populations of the coastal cutthroat trout (O. c. clarkii) are semi-anadromous.
Several subspecies of cutthroat trout are currently listed as threatened in their native ranges due to habitat loss and the introduction of non-native species. Two subspecies, O. c. alvordensis and O. c. macdonaldi, are considered extinct. Cutthroat trout are raised in hatcheries to restore populations in their native ran"

Its range is rapidly expanding across much of eastern North America, displacing native crayfishes in the process. The rusty crayfish was first captured in Illinois in 1973, and has been collected at over 20 locations in the northern portion of the state. In 2005, F. rusticus was found for the first time west of the Continental Divide, in the John Day River, Oregon, which runs into the Columbia River.

Description
Adult rusty crayfish can reach 10 centimeters (4 inches) in length, although they reach maturity at about 4.4 cm (1.7 in), and can range in color from greenish grey, to reddish brown, They can be easily recognized by two ""rusty"", reddish colored spots on the sides of their back and their large front claws with black bands around the tips. Male rusty crayfish have small hook-like features on their first pair of hind legs that they use to hold onto a female while mating.

These tree frogs can vary in size from 2 to 5.5 inches (5 to 12.7 cm) in length. Due to their large size, Cuban tree frogs can eat a wide variety of things, particularly native tree frogs, and their removal has shown to result in an increase in the amount of native tree frogs in an area.

It was originally found only on the Mediterranean islands of Corsica and Sardinia, but has since been introduced into many other regions of Europe. It is not to be confused with Ovis gmelini, also called the mouflon, which is found in Western Asia and is also ancestral to modern domestic sheep.

Description
Male mouflon are known as rams and the females as ewes. The young animals are known as lambs.

Appearance
European mouflon have a body length of up to 120 cm, a shoulder height of 90 cm, a weight of 25 to 40 kg for ewes, 35 to 55 kg for the ram.
The European mouflon has a smooth hairy coat, the rams are fox red-brown in the summer, usually with a whitish saddle patch, the ewes are brownish. Both sexes are darker in winter. The rams have helix-shaped horns up to 80 cm long; females have no horns on Sardinia, but on Corsica they have smaller horns that are slightly curved towards the rear.

Senses
As an animal whose ancestors used to live in open terrain above the tree line, the eyesight of the mouflon is well developed. Its laterally-located eyes allow the mouflon to scan a wide arc without turning its head. In older rams, the field of view may be restricted by the position of the horn tip.

Their common name opossum shrimps stems from the presence of a brood pouch or ""marsupium"" in females. The fact that the larvae are reared in this pouch and are not free-swimming characterises the order. The mysid's head bears a pair of stalked eyes and two pairs of antennae. The thorax consists of eight segments each bearing branching limbs, the whole concealed beneath a protective carapace and the abdomen has six segments and usually further small limbs.
Mysids are found throughout the world in both shallow and deep marine waters where they can be benthic or pelagic, but they are also important in some fresh water and brackish ecosystems. Many benthic species make daily vertical migrations into higher parts of the water column. Mysids are filter feeders, omnivores that feed on algae, detritus and zooplankton. Some mysids are cultured in laboratories for experimental purposes and are used as a food source for other cultured marine organisms. They are sensitive to water pollution, so are sometimes used as bioindicators to monitor water quality.

It is a small bird that has a typical length of 16 cm (6.3 in) and a mass of 24–39.5 g (0.85–1.39 oz). Females and young birds are coloured pale brown and grey, and males have brighter black, white, and brown markings. One of about 25 species in the genus Passer, the house sparrow is native to most of Europe, the Mediterranean Basin, and a large part of Asia. Its intentional or accidental introductions to many regions, including parts of Australasia, Africa, and the Americas, make it the most widely distributed wild bird.
The house sparrow is strongly associated with human habitation, and can live in urban or rural settings. Though found in widely varied habitats and climates, it typically avoids extensive woodlands, grasslands, polar regions, and hot, dry deserts far away from human development. For sustenance, the house sparrow routinely feeds at home and public bird feeding stations, but naturally feeds on the seeds of grains, flowering plants and weeds. However, it is an opportunistic, omnivorous eater, and commonly catches insects, their larvae, caterpillars, invertebrates and many other natural foods.
Because of its numbers, ubiquity, and association with human settlements, the house sparrow is culturally prominent. It is extensively, and usually unsuccessfully, persecuted as an agricultural pest. It has also often been kept as a pet, as well as being a fo"

The plant is popular in Middle Eastern and north African folk medicine. The alkaloids contained in the plant, including the seeds, are monoamine oxidase inhibitors (Harmine, Harmaline).

Etymology
African rue is often used in North American English.Harmel is used in India, Algeria, and Morocco.
It is known in as اسپند in Persian, which is transliterated as espand, or ispand but may also be pronounced or transliterated as sepand, sipand, sifand, esfand, isfand, aspand, or esphand depending on source or dialect. The Persian word اسپند is also the name of the last month of the year, approximately March, in the traditional Persian calendar. It is derived from Middle Persian spand, which is thought, along with the English word spinach, to be ultimately derived from Proto-Iranian *spanta-, 'holy' (compare Avestan 𐬯𐬞𐬆𐬧𐬙𐬀, spəṇta, 'holy', and Middle Persian spenāg, 'holy'), it"

It is native to  fresh and brackish water in West and Central Africa, but has been introduced to other regions where it is considered invasive.Spotted tilapia have high fecundity, simple food requirements and extensive tolerance of environmental variables such as water temperature, salinity, and pollution. These characteristics allow spotted cichlids to rapidly populate many areas that have an appropriate habitat. Typically spotted tilapia tend to be an aggressive and territorial species, and research has found that internal reproductive androgenic factors can overrule the effect of size on dominance encounters in this species.

Appearance
Spotted tilapia have a short rounded snout and three anal spines. They are dark olive green to light yellowish in colour and have eight or nine dark bars on their sides which are more evident in young spotted tilapia than adults. They also have two to six dark spots between the bars on the middle of their side and they reach a maximum standard length of 32.3 cm (1.1 ft). Spotted tilapia have a rapid growth rate and maturation time.

Habitat
Spotted tilapia are native to Africa from the Côte d'Ivoire to Ghana, and Benin to Cameroon. They have also established large feral populations outside of their native ranges, such as in Florida and Australia. Spotted tilapia live in a variety of hab"

The species naturally occurs in fresh and stagnant water bodies throughout much of Sub-Saharan Africa, and in southern Yemen.

Description
The marsh terrapin is typically a rather small turtle, with most individuals being less than 20 cm (7.9 in) in straight carapace length, but one has been recorded with a length of 32.5 cm (12.8 in). It has a black or brown carapace.  The top of the tail and limbs are a grayish brown, while the underside is yellowish.
The male turtle is distinguished by its long, thick tail. A female tends to have a shorter tail and a broader carapace. A hatchling has a shell size of about 3 cm (1.2 in) in length, and is olive to black in color. It also has two small tubercles under the chin and musk glands in the sides of the carapace.
Uniquely, the genus Pelomedusa does not have a hinged plastron (lower shell). All the other species in the family Pelomedusidae, however, do have this feature with which they can, using muscles, close the plastron to the carapace to cover the head and front limbs. Unlike many chelonians, the African helmeted turtle is able, when it finds itself upside down, to right itself with a vigorous flick of its long muscular neck.Recent genetic research suggests that Pelomedusa comprises at l"

It is used for food, particularly in France for the delicacy frog legs. Females are between 5 and 9 cm (2.0 and 3.5 in) long, males between 6 and 11 cm (2.4 and 4.3 in).
This widespread and common frog has many common names, including European dark-spotted frog,  European black-spotted pond frog, and European black-spotted frog.

Distribution
Pelophylax esculentus is endemic to Europe. It naturally occurs from the northern half of France to western Russia, and from Estonia and Denmark to Bulgaria and northern Italy. The edible frog is introduced in Spain, Norway and the United Kingdom. The natural range is nearly identical to that of P. lessonae.

Hybridogenesis
Pelophylax kl. esculentus is the fertile hybrid of the pool frog (Pelophylax lessonae) and the marsh frog (Pelophylax ridibundus). It reproduces by hybridogenesis (hemiclonally).Hybridogenesis implies that during gametogenesis hybrids (of RL genotype) exclude one parental genome (L or R) and produce gametes with an unrecombined genome of the other parental species (R or L, respectively), instead of containing mixed recombined parental genomes. The hybrid populations are usually propagated by mating (backcrosses) with a sympatric parental species – P. lessonae (LL) or P. ridibundus (RR) – providing the"

Description
The pool frog is a small frog which rarely grows to more than 8 cm long, although females can grow up to 9 cm. Males are typically around 5 cm long, while females are around 6–6.5 cm long. These frogs are brown or green, with dark blotches along their backs, a pair of ridges running from each eye and a cream or yellow stripe down the middle of the frog's back. The vocal sacs on the male are cream or even white.

Distribution
The pool frog is found across most of central Europe from the west coast of northern France to the Western part of Russia. There are also small populations of pool frogs in the United Kingdom, Spain, Sweden and Norway. Pool frogs were previously thought to be a non-native species in the UK, but studies have shown that English pool frogs are related to the Swedish and Norwegian populations.The pool frog is found in damp areas with dense vegetation, or in calm, slow flowing rivers, ponds, bogs or marshes.According to Amphibiaweb populations of this frog survive in urban areas and even fisheries.

Description
The marsh frog is the largest type of frog in most of its range, with males growing to a size around 100 mm (3.9 in) SVL and females slightly larger (4 in) SVL. There is a large variation in colour and pattern, ranging from dark green to brown or grey, sometimes with some lighter green lines; a lighter line on the back is generally present. The frog will usually be darker coloured in early spring to absorb heat more efficiently.
Tadpoles can reach up to 190 mm (7.3 in) in length, but this usually occurs in places with long winters where the tadpole has time to grow.

Distribution and habitat
They occur in a large part of Europe starting from western France and spreading out into the Middle East and about a quarter into Russia. There are also isolated populations in Saudi Arabia and the Russian Far East, along with some introduced populations in the United Kingdom and other places.These frogs are very lenient in their habitats, and are able to inhabit a majority of different types of water bodies. Marsh frogs hibernate during the winter either underwater or in burrows, and are able to use the magnetic field of the Earth to locate breeding ponds.

Diet
Adult marsh frogs have a large head that is able to devour a wide variety of prey, mostly arthropods and other invertebrates. In an analysis of 53 adults in Thrace, flies made up 40% and beetles 20% of their "

The yellow perch was described in 1814 by Samuel Latham Mitchill from New York. It is closely related, and morphologically similar to the European perch (Perca fluviatilis); and is sometimes considered a subspecies of its European counterpart.Latitudinal variability in age, growth rates, and size have been observed among populations of yellow perch, likely resulting from differences in day length and annual water temperatures. In many populations, yellow perch often live 9 to 10 years, with adults generally ranging from 4 to 10 in (10 to 25 cm) in length.
The world record for a yellow by weight is 4 lb 3 oz (1.9 kg)), and was caught in May 1865 in Bordentown, New Jersey by Dr. C. Abbot.  It is the longest-standing record for a freshwater fish in North America.

Description
The yellow perch has an elongate, laterally compressed body with a subterminal mouth and a relatively long but blunt snout which is surpassed in length by the lower jaw.  Yellow perch have many fine teeth.  Their bodies are rough to the touch because of their ctenoid scales.  Like most perches, the yellow perch has two separate dorsal fins.

It is the type species of the genus Perca.
The perch is a popular game fish for recreational anglers, and has been widely introduced beyond its native Eurasian habitats into Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Known locally simply as ""redfins"", they have caused substantial damage to native fish populations in Australia and have been proclaimed a noxious species in New South Wales.

Taxonomy
The first scientific description of the river perch was made by Peter Artedi in 1730. He defined the basic morphological signs of this species after studying perch from Swedish lakes. Artedi described its features, counting the fin rays scales and vertebrae of the typical perch.In 1758, Carl Linnaeus named it Perca fluviatilis. His description was based on Artedi's research.Because of their similar appearance and ability to cross-breed, the yellow perch (Perca flavescens) has sometimes been classified as a subspecies of the European perch, in which case its trinomial name would be Perca fluviatilis flavescens.

It is currently the only known member of its genus.

Description
The Chinese sleeper, known as rotan in Russia, resembles a perch, ruffe, or sculpin. The eyes are placed high on the head, which has a rounded snout and projecting lower jaw. There is little or no gap between the two dorsal fins, the front one of which has six to eight spines and the back one, nine to eleven soft rays. The anal fin has one to three spines and seven to ten soft rays. The pelvic fins are not fused together, which helps to distinguish this fish from the gobies. The second dorsal and the anal fins are both more rounded and shorter than the gobies and the caudal fin is also more rounded. The general colour is brownish with a checker-board pattern of darker marks or dark barring. There are dark lines on the head radiating from the eye.  This species can reach a length of 25 centimetres (9.8 in) TL and the greatest recorded weight for a specimen is 250 grams (8.8 oz).

Distribution and habitat

It is harvested for food but is also known to harbor toxins and cause damage to submerged structures such as drainage pipes. It is native in the Asia-Pacific region but has been introduced in the Caribbean, and in the waters around Japan, North America, and South America.

Description
Perna viridis ranges from 80 to 100 millimetres (3 to 4 in) in length and may occasionally reach 165 millimetres (6 in). Its shell ends in a downward-pointing beak. The smooth periostracum is dark green, becoming increasingly brownish towards its point of attachment (umbo), where it is lighter. Younger mussels are bright green and that becomes darker as it ages. The shell's interior has a pale-blue sheen.
The mussel has a large mobile foot which it uses to climb vertically should it be covered by sediments. It also produces byssus to help it attach to its substrate.Perna canaliculus and Perna perna are two similar species, native to the waters of New Zealand and Africa respectively.

From this relative, Peromyscus species are distinguished by relatively larger eyes, and also often two-tone coloring, with darker colors over the dorsum (back), and white abdominal and limb hair-coloring. In reference to the coloring, the word Peromyscus comes from Greek words meaning ""booted mouse"". They are also accomplished jumpers and runners by comparison to house mice, and their common name of ""deer mouse"" (coined in 1833) is in reference to this agility.The most common species of deer mice in the continental United States are two closely related species, P. maniculatus and P. leucopus. In the United States, Peromyscus is the most populous mammalian genus overall, and has become notorious in the western United States as a carrier of hantaviruses.

P. bahiensis is very similar in appearance to Phoneutria fera and Phoneutria reidyi: its anterior flat lobe is convex while much more distinct in P. fera, and poorly developed in P. reidyi. The pedipalps are dorsally dark brown, with the retrolateral face of the patella and tibia with barn bands. The opistosome is dorsally dark brown, with yellow-orange bristles. The ventral part is dark brown with four series of light yellow spots. In males, the tibia is equal to or greater than the cambium, and the plunger is straight with a slightly curved tip. The males also have a reduced retrolateral tibial apophysis of the pedipalp. The coloration of the males is similar to that of the females, except for the exchange with a median longitudinal orange band. The cheliceras of the females are dark brown with yellow bristles. Phoneutria bahiensis is usually found on top of trees in the Atlantic Forest. It is carnivorous, feeding on insects, other spiders, frogs, lizards, and small mice. Like other wandering spiders it does not use webs to hunt, instead actively hunting on the forest floor. It attacks and uses a paralyzing toxin to immobilize its prey.

It is the only extant species of the genus Phractocephalus. This fish is common in the aquarium trade, although its massive adult size makes it unsuitable for all but the largest aquariums. They feed on fish, crustaceans and fallen fruits. They are not evaluated by IUCN.

Fossil species
Although the redtail catfish is the only living representative of this genus, there are other members that date back to the upper Miocene, and are only known from fossil remains. P. nassi was described in 2003, from the Urumaco Formation at Urumaco, Venezuela. Another fossil species, P. acreornatus, is known from the Solimões Formation, Acre, Brazil.

Pittosporum undulatum grows as a shrub or small tree to 15 m (49 ft) tall. Its evergreen leaves are lance-shaped (lanceolate), with wavy (undulating) margins. It carries conspicuous orange woody fruits about 1 cm in diameter for several months after flowering in spring or early summer.

Taxonomy
French botanist Étienne Pierre Ventenat described Pittosporum undulatum in 1802.

Distribution and habitat
Originally Pittosporum undulatum grew in moist areas on the Australian east coast, where its natural range was from south-east Queensland to eastern Victoria, but has increased its range since European settlement.

Ecology
Likely pollinators of its flowers are moths and butterflies, as the flower produces a fragrant perfume at night. The fruit are eaten by currawongs, red-whiskered bulbuls, Indian mynahs and grey-headed flying fox. Seed is dispersed in bird faeces.

Invasive species
The earliest known record (according to the Australian Virtual Herbarium) is from Port Jackson, Sydney, in 1803. However, P. undulatum's status around the Sydney area is contentious. Even though it is native to the regio"

It is known under numerous common names, including common tree frog, four-lined tree frog, golden tree frog or striped tree frog. Many past authors have united it with the common Indian tree frog in P. maculatus (or Rhacophorus maculatus, as was common in older times), but today they are generally considered distinct species. In its native range, it is also called ""white-lipped tree frog"", but this name is otherwise applied to a species of true tree frogs (family Hylidae).
Polypedates leucomystax is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN. It is in fact a species complex containing various cryptic species within it.

Range
Previously, P. leucomystex was thought to distribute below the Red River of Vietnam and in western Yunnan, while P. megacephalus can be found above the Red River and in Northeast India. However, recent genetic studies revealed that the natural barriers between these species are the Isthmus of Kra and the Tenasserim Range, where P. leucomystax can be found below the isthmus and west of the range.The Polypedates leucomystax complex began diverging during the Pliocene, and spread quickly after the Pleistocene due to human activity. The range of P. leucomystax has recently expanded in the Philippines and Indonesia due to the widespread conversion of forests into agricultural-use land. It is also frequently found in trans-island agricultural shipments. Lineages on the Indochina "

These snails were most likely introduced to the United States through the aquarium trade.

Subspecies
Pomacea bridgesii bridgesii (Reeve, 1856)
Pomacea bridgesii diffusa (Blume, 1957)

Anatomy
Mystery snails possess structurally complex eyes at the tip of a cephalic eyestalk. They are able to regenerate the eye completely after amputation through the mid-eyestalk. They are born with both gills and lungs. Mystery snails also possess a siphon which is a small tube used to breathe air. They frequently surface to breathe.

Distribution
The native distribution of this snail is Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Peru.

Non-indigenous distribution
This species is non-indigenous in Hawaii since 1960 (Pomacea bridgesii diffusa), southeast Asia since the 1980s, and Florida since the early 1980s (Pomacea bridgesii diffusa).

Offspring
Most mystery snails lay their eggs above the water line. They are gonochoristic which means a male and female must be present for reproduction. The eggs take 2–4 weeks to hatch. The snails can produce as many as two hundred offspring from one egg-laying event. Sometimes not all the eggs are fertilized so they do not all hatch. When they do hatch, the hatchlings run the risk of being eaten if they share an aquarium with fish. Hatchling mystery snails wi"

It has spread widely beyond its native range, beginning in the 1700s when it spread via canals constructed in western Russia and since the 1900s through introducions to many regions for human consumption. Today it is widespread throughout much of Europe.

Description
Pontastacus leptodactylus can grow up to 30 centimetres (12 in) in length from the tip of the rostrum to the end of the telson (tail), but is more commonly found at around 15 cm (6 in) in length. The sides of the thorax are very rough, usually pale yellow to pale green in colour. P. leptodactylus has two pairs of post-orbital ridges, the second of which may have spines. It also has a prominent tubercle (small nodule) on shoulder of the carapace. The claws of Pontastacus leptodactylus are long and narrow (hence the common name 'narrow-clawed crayfish'). Their upper surface is rough and the underside is the same colour as the body. A tubercle can be found on the fixed side of the claw.

The genus name Populus is from the Latin for poplar, and the specific epithet balsamifera from Latin for ""balsam-bearing"".Populus balsamifera is the northernmost North American hardwood, growing transcontinentally on boreal and montane upland and flood plain sites, and attaining its best development on flood plains. It is a hardy, fast-growing tree which is generally short lived, but some trees as old as 200 years have been found.The tree is known for its strong, sweet fragrance, which emanates from its sticky, resinous buds. The smell has been compared to that of the balsam fir tree.

Taxonomy
The black cottonwood, Populus trichocarpa, is sometimes considered a subspecies of P. balsamifera and may lend its common name to this species, although the black poplars and cottonwoods of Populus sect. Aigeiros are not closely related.
The balm-of-Gilead (Populus × jackii), also known as P. × gileadensis, is the hybrid between P. balsamifera and the eastern cottonwood (P. deltoides), occurring occasionally where the two parental species' ranges overlap. This hybrid is also sometimes planted as a shade tree, and sometimes escapes from cultivation.

Name
The name Populus is from the Latin for poplar, and grandidentata refers to the coarse teeth on the leaves (grandis meaning ""large"", and dentata meaning ""toothed"").

Description
Populus grandidentata is a medium-sized deciduous tree native to North America, found mostly in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. Leaves are similar to Populus tremuloides, but slightly larger and having larger teeth. The leaves tremble in the wind as those of P. tremuloides do. Bark of younger trees is olive-green, thin and smooth; after 30–40 years, the bark is gray, thick and rough with grooves.

Reproduction
Bigtooth aspens produce seeds from wind-pollinated flower clusters, known as catkins. The tree is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are on separate trees, which flower from mid-April to mid-May depending on the climate zone. The seed, a two-valved capsule, is distributed widely by the wind. Seed production begins around 10 years old. Individuals can also reproduce through the roots after a disturbance event, such as fire or harvest; the roots of the dead/cut tree will begin to send up suckers, creating identical individuals, and can result in a stand of clones that resemble that individual. Seeds viability is high (around 80%) but despite this and the sheer number of seeds produ"

From the French name talève sultane, it is also known as the sultana bird. This chicken-sized bird, with its large feet, bright plumage and red bill and frontal shield is easily recognisable in its native range. It used to be considered the nominate subspecies of the purple swamphen, but is now recognised as a separate species. The western swamphen is found in wetlands in Spain (where the largest population lives), Portugal, southeastern France, Italy (Sardinia and Sicily) and northwestern Africa (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia).

Behaviour
The species makes loud, quick, bleating and hooting calls which are hardly bird-like in tone. It is particularly noisy during the breeding season. Despite being clumsy in flight, it can fly long distances and is a good swimmer, especially for a bird without webbed feet.

Breeding
Western swamphens are generally seasonal breeders, correlating with peak rainfall in many places, or summer in more temperate climes. The purple swamphen breeds in warm reed beds. The pattern of social behaviour tends to be monogamy.Pairs nest in a large pad of interwoven reed flags, etc., on a mass of floating debris or amongst matted reeds slightly above water level in swamps, clumps of rushes in paddocks or long unkempt grass.

Marbled crayfish are closely related to the ""slough crayfish"", Procambarus fallax, which is widely distributed across Florida. No natural populations of marbled crayfish are known. Information provided by one of the original pet traders as to where the marbled crayfish originated was deemed ""totally confusing and unreliable"". The informal name Marmorkrebs is German for ""marbled crayfish"".

Model organism
Marbled crayfish were the first known decapod crustaceans to reproduce by parthenogenesis. All individuals are female, and the offspring are genetically identical to the parent. Marbled crayfish are triploid animals with 276 chromosomes, which may be the main reason for their parthenogenetic reproduction. It is hypothesized that marbled crayfish originated from an error in meiosis resulting in a diploid gamete, which was then fertilized and created a viable triploid individual in a single generation. Marbled crayfish are thus a model for the rapid generation of species. Unlike other parthenogenetic organisms, the marbled crayfish is a relatively young species; it was discovered in 1995.Because marbled crayfish are genetically identical, easy to care for, and reproduce at high rates, they are a potential model organism, particularly for studying development. A major drawback, however, is the long generation time (several months) co"

They have extremely long roots to seek water from very far under ground. As a legume, mesquites are one of the few sources of fixed nitrogen in the desert habitat. The trees bloom from spring to summer. They often produce fruits known as ""pods"". Prosopis spp. are able to grow up to 8 metres (26 ft) tall, depending on site and climate. They are deciduous and depending on location and rainfall have either deep or shallow roots. Prosopis is considered long-lived because of the low mortality rate after the dicotyledonous stage and juveniles are also able to survive in conditions with low light and drought. The Cahuilla indigenous people of western North America were known to eat the seeds of mesquite.

History
Prosopis spp. have been in North America since the Pliocene era and their wood has been dated to 3300 yr BP. They are thought to have evolved with megafauna in the New World.  The loss of North American megafauna at the end of the Pleistocene era gave way to one theory of how the Prosopis spp. were able to survive. One theory is that the loss of the megafauna allowed Prosopis spp. to use their fruit pods to attract other organisms to spread their seeds;  then, with the introduction of livestock, they were able to spread into grasslands. Another is that Prosopis spp. had always been present in grasslands,"

It has a loud three or four note call, feeds on fruits and small insects and perches conspicuously on trees. It is common in hill forests and urban gardens.

Taxonomy
The red-whiskered bulbul was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Lanius jocosus. The specific epithet is from Latin ioculus meaning ""merry"" (from iocus meaning ""joke""). Linnaeus based his description on the Sitta Chinensis that had been described in 1757 by the Swedish naturalist Pehr Osbeck. Linnaeus specified the location as ""China"" but this was restricted to Hong Kong and Kwangtung (now Guangdong) by Herbert Girton Deignan in 1948. The red-whiskered bulbul is now placed in the genus Pycnonotus that was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826.Hybrids have been noted in captivity with the red-vented, white-eared, white-spectacled, black-capped and Himalayan bulbuls. Leucism has also been recorded.

It is the only species of the genus Pylodictis. Ranging from the lower Great Lakes region to northern Mexico, it has been widely introduced and is an invasive species in some areas.  The closest living relative of the flathead catfish is the much smaller widemouth blindcat, Satan eurystomus.

Common names
The flathead catfish is also known as the yellow cat, mud cat, Johnnie cat, goujon, appaluchion, opelousas, pied cat and Mississippi cat.  In dialect of the Ozark mountains it may be referred to as a ""granny cat.""

Description
The flathead catfish is olive colored on its sides and dorsum, with a white to yellow underside. Individuals, particularly young specimens from clearer waters, may be strongly mottled with dark brown to black color.  The eyes are small and the lower jaw prominently projects beneath the upper.  A premaxillary tooth pad has posterior extensions.  The caudal fin is emarginate in structure, and its upper lobe may bear an isolated white margin. The fins are otherwise brown, though the body's mottling may extend into the fins.  The anal fin has 14 to 17 rays and a round margin.The flathead catfish grows to a length of 155 cm (61 in) and may weigh up to 55.79 kg (123.0 lb), making it the second-largest North American catfish (after the blue catfish, Ictalurus furc"

It was named by Linnaeus in 1758, who considered it a bunting, but Ludwig Reichenbach assigned it in 1850 to the new genus Quelea. Three subspecies are recognised, with Quelea quelea quelea occurring roughly from Senegal to Chad, Q. q. aethiopica from Sudan to Somalia and Tanzania, and Q. q. lathamii from Gabon to Mozambique and South Africa. Non-breeding birds have light underparts, striped brown upper parts, yellow-edged flight feathers and a reddish bill. Breeding females attain a yellowish bill. Breeding males have a black (or rarely white) facial mask, surrounded by a purplish, pinkish, rusty or yellowish wash on the head and breast. The species avoids forests, deserts and colder areas such as those at high altitude and in southern South Africa. It constructs oval roofed nests woven from strips of grass hanging from thorny branches, sugar cane or reeds. It breeds in very large colonies.
The quelea feeds primarily on seeds of annual grasses, but also causes extensive damage to cereal crops. Therefore, it is sometimes called ""Africa's feathered locust"". The usual pest-control measures are spraying avicides or detonating fire-bombs in the enormous colonies during the night. Extensive control measures have be"

Description
This species is fat and has long limbs and a pointy snout. Adult males are rarely larger than 6.5 cm, while females can grow up to 8 cm. Its dorsal surface is light brown, reddish-brown, or light greyish-brown with very little contrast. Triangle-shaped spots reach from the temple to the eardrum, which are dark brown. The underside of the agile frog is white without any spots. During mating season, the males often become dark brown.The hind legs are unusually long, which allow this species to jump further than other similar frogs - they have been known to jump up to two metres in distance. The pupils are horizontal. The colour of the upper third of the iris (above the pupil) is lighter and gold in coloration. The tympanum is about the size of the diameter of the eye. The gland stripes on the frog's back are not very developed and partially interrupted.

Distribution
The agile frog can be found in France, the Channel Islands, parts of Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, on the Balkans, Greece, and by the Black Sea.

Taxonomy
Pig frogs (Lithobates grylio) are a species of frog that belong to the class Amphibia, the order Anura, the family Ranidae, and the genus Lithobates. They are part of the phylum Chordata, which includes animals with a notochord and a hollow nerve cord. Pig frogs are vertebrates, meaning they have a backbone, and they are tetrapods, meaning they have four limbs. They are adapted to living both on land and in water, and they are commonly found in the southeastern United States. Norwegian-American naturalist Leonhard Stejneger described the pig frog in 1901, and it still bears its original name. The name comes from the calls the frog makes, sounding like a pig grunting.

Description
The pig frog is green or grey-green in color, with brown or black blotching. It has fully webbed feet, a sharply pointed nose, and large tympana (eardrums). The Pig frog is sexually dimorphic in size and coloration, the males also have a larger tympanum than the females. It is easily mistaken for various other species of the genus Lithobates, with which it shares its geographic range, including the American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeiana). Pig frogs grow to a snout to vent length (SVL) of 85 to 140 millimetres (3+1⁄4 to 5+1⁄2 inches). They are known for their loud, deep snorting sound"

Its natural habitats are temperate  rivers, swamps, freshwater lakes and freshwater marshes. It is threatened by habitat loss.

Taxonomy
Historically, the river frog has been known as Rana heckscheri but was placed in the genus Lithobates by Frost et al., 2006, this being a separate genus of ranid frogs that included most of the North American frogs traditionally included in the genus Rana. This change has proved controversial, and some authorities treat Lithobates as a subgenus of Rana, with the river frog's scientific name being written Rana (Lithobates) heckscheri.

Description
The river frog is a very large species with adults commonly between 7 and 13 cm (3 and 5 in) in length. The skin is rough and wrinkled but there are no dorso-lateral ridges as there are in the green frog (Lithobates clamitans). The back is some shade of dark green or blackish-green and the belly is dark grey, or blackish with pale wavy lines and specks. A distinctive characteristic is white spots on the lips, particularly on the lower lip, and this helps to distinguish this species from bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) and pig frogs (Rana grylio). Another distinguishing feature is a pale band outlining the groin. Males have a yellowish throat and their tympani (eardrums) are larger than their eyes while those of females are smaller.

499,일본산개구리,Japanese brown frog,Rana japonica</em>,유입주의 생물,양서류,Rana japonica,"The Japanese brown frog (Rana japonica) is a species of frog in the family Ranidae, endemic to Japan. Its natural habitats are temperate grassland, rivers, swamps, irrigated land, and seasonally flooded agricultural land.

Characteristics
Defining characteristics include a slender, reddish-brown body with a long, narrow head. The average snout-vent length is 48 mm (0.157 ft) for males. Females are usually much larger than males, with lengths of about 54 mm (0.177 ft). Neither gender has a vocal sac, but males develop yellowish-brown nuptial pads and sing during mating season (which lasts from January to March). Songs consist of 10 to 20 notes.

Habitat
R. japonica occurs in Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu in Japan to the southern region of China. Within Japan, it inhabits mostly hillsides and plains and is rarely seen in mountain ranges. More specifically, the brown frog resides in temperate grasslands, hillsides, plains, rivers, swamps, irrigated land, and seasonally flooded agricultural land.

Translucent breed
By combining two types of recessive genes that cause frogs to become translucent, a breed of Rana japonica, popularly called ""see-through frogs"", was produced by Japanese scientists in 2007 to see the frog's organs, blood cells, and eggs without dissection. The skin is not clear, but translucent. Cancer growths can be seen more easily.

Predators
Tadpole larvae of R. japonica are known to be consumed by aquatic larvae of the Ezo salamander, Hynobius retardatus.

It is the state amphibian of Minnesota and Vermont.

Description
The northern leopard frog is a fairly large species of frog, reaching about 11 cm (4.3 in) in snout-to-vent length. It varies from green to brown in dorsal color, with large, dark, circular spots on its back, sides, and legs. Each spot is normally bordered by a lighter ring. A pair of dorsolateral folds starting from the back of the eye runs parallel to each other down the back. These dorsolateral folds are often lighter or occasionally pinkish in colour. Also, a pale stripe runs from the nostril, under the eye and tympanum, terminating at the shoulder. The ventral surface is white or pale green. The iris is golden and toes are webbed.
Tadpoles are dark brown or grey, with light blotches on the underside. The tail is pale tan.

Color variations
The northern leopard frog has several different color variations, with the most common two being the green and the brown morphs, with another morph known as the burnsi morph. Individuals with the burnsi morph coloration lack spots on their backs, but may or may not retain them on their legs. They can be bright green or brown and have yellow dorsal folds.

The species is endemic to Asia.

Description
Rhabdophis subminiatus has a greenish hue with red and yellow regions near the head. It grows to 70 to 90 cm (27.5 to 35.5 in) in total length (including tail). Female is much larger than male, mating behavior multiple males may swarm a single female.

Habitat and diet
The red-necked keelback generally lives near ponds, where it consumes frogs and fish.

Snakebite and venom
Rhabdophis subminiatus is a rear-fanged species and was previously thought to be harmless. However, following one fatal and several near-fatal envenomations, the toxicity of its venom was investigated. As a result, it has recently been reclassified as a dangerous species. Rear-fanged snakes need to bite and hold on, or repeatedly bite, to have any effect on humans. A chewing action facilitates envenomation, as the venom ducts open to fangs that are externally grooved (not hollow) and are posterior in the oral cavity. R. subminiatus has enlarged and ungrooved teeth. The species has two enlarged teeth in the back of the jaw. Located in the upper jaw is a gland known as Duvernoy's gland, which produces an extremely venomous secretion.

Symptoms caused by venom
When the snake bites, the salivary venom mixture is not injected, but it flows into the punctures produced by the upper jaw's rear "

Etymology
The specific Latin name alaternus, is from the Latin word for the plant. Its origin is obscure but is often suggested to be of Etruscan or pre-Indo-European Mediterranean origin.

Description
Rhamnus alaternus is an evergreen shrub 1–5 metres (3 ft 3 in – 16 ft 5 in) high. The stems have reddish bark and  pubescent young branches, rounded and compact foliage with alternating leaves, 2–6 centimetres (0.79–2.36 in) long, sometimes nearly opposite, oval or lanceolate, leathery, shiny green, yellowish-green underneath.
The small fragrant flowers are gathered in a short axillary yellow-green raceme. The flowering period extends from February to April. Fruits are obovoidal red-brownish drupes of about 3–4 millimetres (0.12–0.16 in),  containing from 2 to 4 seeds. The drupes  darken to black when ripe.

The lower cauline leaves are smaller, pinnately lobed; the upper leaves become much reduced, sessile, serrate to entire. The heads are numerous terminating the branches. Flowers are pink to purplish, the marginal ones not enlarged. The outer and middle involucral bracts are broad, striate, smooth with broadly rounded tips; the inner bracts are narrower with hairy tips. Pappus present with bristles 6–11 mm long. Fruit is a whitish, slightly ridged achene.
Russian knapweed is a deep-rooted long-lived perennial. Some stands have been in existence for 75 years. It forms dense colonies in cultivated fields, orchards, pastures, and roadsides.
A native to Eurasia, Russian knapweed was introduced into North America in the late 19th century.

It is a member of the genus Rhinella, which includes many true toad species found throughout Central and South America, but it was formerly assigned to the genus Bufo.
The cane toad is an old species. A fossil toad (specimen UCMP 41159) from the La Venta fauna of the late Miocene in Colombia is indistinguishable from modern cane toads from northern South America. It was discovered in a floodplain deposit, which suggests the R. marina habitat preferences have long been for open areas. The cane toad is a prolific breeder; females lay single-clump spawns with thousands of eggs. Its reproductive success is partly because of opportunistic feeding: it has a diet, unusual among anurans, of both dead and living matter. Adults average 10–15 cm (4–6 in) in length; the largest recorded specimen had a snout-vent length of 24 cm (9.4 in).
The cane toad has poison glands, and the tadpoles are highly toxic to most animals if ingested.

It was originally described as Cyprinus amarus by Marcus Elieser Bloch in 1782, and has been referred to in scientific literature as Rhodeus sericeus amarus. It is known simply as ""the bitterling"" in its native range, where it is the only species of its genus Rhodeus, and sometimes in the scientific literature, also, but this is technically wrong, being a leftover from the times when the European bitterling was united with its Siberian relative, the Amur bitterling, in R. sericeus. Properly, ""bitterling"" can refer to any species of Acheilognathus or Rhodeus.

It is native to Eastern North America in the United States and Canada, but has been introduced elsewhere in North America, as well as to Iceland, Europe, and Asia. In parts of its range, it is also known as the eastern brook trout, speckled trout, brook charr, squaretail, brookie or mud trout, among others. A potamodromous population in Lake Superior, is known as coaster trout or, simply, as coasters. Anadromous populations which are found in coastal rivers from Long Island to Hudson Bay are sometimes referred to as salters. The brook trout is the state fish of nine U.S. states: Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia, and the Provincial Fish of Nova Scotia in Canada.

Systematics and taxonomy
The brook trout was first scientifically described as Salmo fontinalis by the naturalist Samuel Latham Mitchill in 1814. The specific epithet ""fontinalis"" comes from the Latin for ""of a spring or fountain"", in reference to the clear, cold streams and ponds in its native habitat. The species was later moved to the char genus Salvelinus, which in North America also includes the lake trout, bull trout, Dolly Varden, and the Arctic char.
There is little recognized systematic substructure in the brook trout, but two subspecies have been proposed. On the other hand, three ecological forms"

It is usually referred to as common salvinia or water spangles. Salvinia minima is native to South America, Mesoamerica, and the West Indies and was introduced to the United States in the 1920s-1930s. It is classified as an invasive species internationally and can be detrimental to native ecosystems. This species is similar to but should not be confused with giant salvinia, Salvinia molesta.

Description
The leaves of Salvinia minima are small and oval, ranging from 0.4 to 2 centimeters in length. Each rhizome of the fern floats close to the surface and has a joined set of leaves that branch off horizontally. The leaves grow in joined sets of three, with two leaves floating on the surface and one leaf dissected, hanging underneath. This species is rootless but the dissected leaves that hang down act as root-like structures and are longer than the floating leaves. Fine white hairs grow uniformly on the leaf surface and serve to repel water. The hairs grow in groups of four but do not touch at the tips. There are longer brown hairs present on the underside of leaves as well. Leaves range from bright green to brown in color, often browning with age and in sunlight.

Growth
Salvinia minima undergoes three unique stages of growth. In the primary (initial) stage, a single bud or a small number of buds of the fern are introduced to an environment. In this stage, the leaves will lie f"

It is found in freshwater and brackish habitats in western Eurasia. It is a popular game fish and has been introduced to a variety of localities outside its native range. It is the type species of the genus Sander.

Taxonomy
The zander was first formally described in 1758 as Perca lucioperca by Carolus Linnaeus in volume 1 of the tenth edition of Systema Naturae and he gave the type locality as ""European lakes"". When Lorenz Oken (1779-1851) created the genus Sander he made Perca lucioperca its type species. The zander is part of the European clade within the genus Sander which split from a common ancestor with the North American clade, which the walleye (S. vitreus) and the sauger (S. canadensis) belong to, around 20.8 million years ago. Within the European clade the Volga pikeperch (S. volgaensis) is the most basal taxon and shares features with the North American clade, such as being a broadcast spawner. In contrast in the zander and the estuarine perch (S. marinus)  the males build nests and the female spawn into these nests and the males then guard the eggs and fry. The lineage leading to the zander is thought to have diverged from the common ancestor with the Volga pikeperch circa 13.8 million years ago while the split from the estuarine perch took place around 9.1 million years ago.

It is a North American close relative of the European zander, also known as the pikeperch. The walleye is sometimes called the yellow walleye to distinguish it from the blue walleye, which is a color morph that was once found in the southern Ontario and Quebec regions, but is now presumed extinct. However, recent genetic analysis of a preserved (frozen) 'blue walleye' sample suggests that the blue and yellow walleye were simply phenotypes within the same species and do not merit separate taxonomic classification.In parts of its range in English-speaking Canada, the walleye is known as a pickerel,  though the fish is not related to the true pickerels, which are members of the family Esocidae.Walleyes show a fair amount of variation across watersheds. In general, fish within a watershed are quite similar and are genetically distinct from those of nearby watersheds. The species has been artificially propagated for over a century and has been planted on top of existing populations or introduced into waters naturally devoid of the species, sometimes reducing the overall genetic distinctiveness of populations.

Etymology
The name ""walleye"" comes from its pearlescent eyes caused by the reflective tapetum lucidum which, in addition to allowing the fish to see well in "

It is found in Austria, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine.

Description
The Volga pikeperch is considerably smaller than the zander or common pike-perch (Sander lucioperca). It grows to a maximum length of 40 cm (16 in), weighing 2 kg. It differs from Sander lucioperca by not having large ""vampire"" like canine teeth, also the colour is more silvery-grey than green, with much more distinguishable dark stripes on the side. Its second dorsal fin has nineteen to twenty-one branched soft rays and the number of scales along the lateral line is seventy to eighty-three.

Distribution and habitat
The Volga pikeperch is found in the northern Black Sea basin from the Danube, as far upstream as Vienna, to the Kuban River drainages. It is also present in the Caspian Sea basin in the Volga River and Ural River drainages. It inhabits large, turbid rivers and lakes, as well as brackish estuaries and may make short migrations to breed.

Biology
The Volga pikeperch is most active at dusk and dawn when it feeds on small fish and invertebrates. Males become mature by the age of three or four and females a year later, at a minimum length of 20 cm (8 in). Breeding takes place during April and May in shallow water with a sandy or gravelly bottom. The male scrapes a shallow depression in the substrat"

523,검은턱틸라피아,,Sarotherodon melanotheron</em>,유입주의 생물,어류,Sarotherodon melanotheron,"The blackchin tilapia (Sarotherodon melanotheron) is a species of cichlid native to coastal west Africa. It is a paternal mouthbrooder which has been introduced to Asia and North America.

In the Philippines, it is also informally called gloria or tilapiang arroyo after former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo because of its small size and mole-like dark pigmentation under its lower jaw, resembling that of the short stature and mole on the former president's left cheek.

Description
The blackchin tilapia, is pale in colour, that colour varying in shades including light blue, orange and golden yellow which normally has dark patches on the chin of adults. It also normally has dark colouration on the posterior edge of the gill and on the tips of the soft rays of the dorsal fin. The body is typically marked with irregular bars, spots or splotches. It has a small mouth which is equipped with as many as a few hundred tiny teeth which are arranged in 3-6 rows. They display minimal sexual dimorphism with the heads of adult males usually being slightly larger than the heads of females, some males may also show gold tinting on the operculum.[3] The dorsal fin has 15 - 17 spines and 10-12 soft rays, the anal fin has 3 spines and 8-10 soft rays and the length of caudal peduncle is equal to 0.6-0.9 times its depth.[2] It can grow to a maximum length of 28 centimetres (11 in) but more normally attains 17.5 centimetres (6.9 in).[3]

Distribution
The blackchin tilapia is native to western Africa from Mauritania to Cameroon. It has been introduced to several countries in Asia, USA and Europe.[2] It has also become an invasive species in Florida,[4] Thailand,[5] and the Philippines.[6]

Habitat and biology
The blackchin tilapia is able to tolerate high salinities and it can be found abundantly in mangrove areas and is able to move into freshwaters, such as the lower reaches of streams, and in to salt waters. In West Africa, it is restricted to brackish lagoons and estuaries, and is abundant in the mangroves. It forms schools and it is largely nocturnal, although it will feed during the day infrequently. The diet is largely aufwuchs and detritus supplemented with bivalves and zooplankton It feeds by picking up and swallowing in bites, it lacks gill rakers.[2]

Spawning occurs close to the shore in shallow water. The female actively courts the male, digs pits and leads in mating. The male eventually reacts in a largely passive manner and the pair will establish a bond. It is paternal mouth brooder,[2] but females of one of the strains in Ghana also exhibit the potential for oral‐brooding.[7]

Invasive species
In Florida, this species appears to have been introduced via escapes from the aquarium trade, although some deliberate releases are suspected. In some areas Blackchin tilapia can make up to 90% of the fish biomass. They can then spread disease to and out compete native fish. In Hawaii it is sometimes called the ""saltwater tilapia"" because it has the ability to survive and possibly even breed in pure seawater. In these islands it is found off sheltered beaches and in lagoons around O`ahu and possibly the other islands. This species is regarded as a pest in canals and reservoirs in Hawaii, they breed rapidly, out-compete any other species present, and then they frequently have massive die-offs. For example, in 1991 at Lake Wilson on O`ahu, there was a fungal infection which killed off an estimated 20,000 tilapia, the majority of which were blackchin tilapia. This was thought to represent at most 0.5% of the total population of tilapia in the reservoir.[3]

In the Philippines, there is no record on how the blackchin tilapia was introduced into the country's waters, but it is believed that around as early as 2015, it may have come from the aquarium trade and released into the wild in the waters near provinces of Bataan and Bulacan. The species is considered a threat towards fish ponds as they multiply very quickly, taking up space for other fish, particularly those for breeding bangus (milkfish).[6] Given the nearby proximity to Bataan and Bulacan, blackchin tilapia is also present in Manila Bay, despite not being a freshwater body as it was among the fish that had washed ashore along the Baseco shoreline on September 17, 2020.[8]"

Origin and range
Where S. aculeatissimum is native to has yet to be conclusively determined. Despite its common name suggesting a South-Asian origin, however, the plant's origin is most likely either Africa or South America; while specimens have been identified in Asia, it is rare there and believed to be the result of accidental or deliberate introduction. It is closely related to other Solanum species native to both sub-Saharan Africa and Central America. Africa was the first continent in which S. aculeatissimum was documented.  Scottish-born botanist Francis Masson found the plant near the Cape of Good Hope either during the years 1772–1774, or during a subsequent expedition when he remained in southern Africa from 1786 until 1795. In South America, the plant was first described in 1816-1821 by Augustin Saint-Hilaire.

Properties and uses
The fruit are considered toxic, and force-feeding of either ripe or unripe fruit has led to deaths in cattle. Free-ranging cattle apparently avoid feeding on the fruit.

It is native to the coastline of southern South America, where it is a resident of salt marshes. It is also known on the west coast of the North America and parts of the Mediterranean coast as an introduced species and in some areas a noxious weed. In California it is a troublesome invasive species of marshes in San Francisco Bay and in Humboldt Bay, where it was introduced during the 19th century from Chile in ballast.

Description
This perennial grass generally lacks rhizomes. It grows in erect clumps of slender stems that can reach 1.5 meters tall. The long, narrow, gray-green leaves are rolled inward, especially when new. The inflorescence is a narrow, dense, spike-like stick of branches appressed together, the unit reaching up to 30 centimetres long. The flowers are colorless and the spikelets are tipped with bristles.

Invasive species
This species has negative impacts on the salt marsh habitat of the California coast. It forms tight clumps of herbage that raise the elevation of the plants in the marsh, keeping the water from flowing in as far as it naturally would, and increasing sediment accumulation. It competes with its native relative, California cordgrass (Sporobolus foliosus), and other marsh plants such as pickleweed (Salicornia pacifica). Efforts"

Distribution
This bunchgrass is native to temperate and tropical areas of the Americas.
It can be found in more regions, as well as on many Pacific Islands, as an introduced species and a common weed of disturbed habitat. It is naturalized in Hawaii, Fiji, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Midway Atoll, and other areas.

Description
Sporobolus indicus is a perennial bunchgrass producing a tuft of stems up to about a meter (3 feet) tall. The hairless leaves are up to 50 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a dense, narrow, spikelike panicle of grayish or light brown spikelets, its base sometimes sheathed by the upper leaf.
The inflorescence and upper leaves are sometimes coated in black smut fungus of the genus Bipolaris, the reason for the common name smut grass.The 1889 book The Useful Native Plants of Australia records that common names included ""Rat-tail Grass"" ""Chilian Grass"" and that Indigenous People of the Cloncurry River area of Northern Australia called it ""Jil-crow-a-berry"". It also states that Sporobolus indicus is ""A fine, open, pasture grass, found throughout the colonies. Its numerous penetrating roots enable it to resist severe drought. It yields a fair amount of fodder, much relished by stock, but is too coarse for sheep. The seeds form the principal food of many small birds. It has been suggested as a paper-making material.""

Stratiotes acoroides  - Enhalus acoroides
Stratiotes alismoides - Ottelia alismoides
Stratiotes nymphoides - Hydrocleys nymphoides
Stratiotes quinquealatus - Ottelia alismoides

Description
The leaves are serrate and very brittle, breaking easily when handled. Reproduction is generally by offsets, which may number five or more per plant. In the UK, male plants have rarely if ever been recorded, although some hermaphrodite flowers have been recorded from more southerly locations. Sexual reproduction is not known to occur. A characteristic of the genus is the habit of the plants rising to the surface at flowering time.

Ecology
The plant appears to be associated with calcareous waters and there is a suggestion that changing levels of calcium carbonate on the leaves may explain the floating and submerging behaviour.

The rare dragonfly, the Norfolk hawker (Aeshna isosceles), relies on the presence of Stratiotes aloides as a food source for the smaller insects on which it feeds.
They are very winter hardy

The species has been introduced to many parts of the world and feral populations have become established.
This species was formerly included in the genus Streptopelia with other turtle-doves, but studies suggest that they differ from typical members of that genus. This dove is long tailed buff brown with a white-spotted black collar patch on the back and sides of the neck. The tail tips are white and the wing coverts have light buff spots.
There are considerable plumage variations across populations within its wide range. The species is found in light forests and gardens as well as in urban areas. They fly from the ground with an explosive flutter and will sometimes glide down to a perch. It is also called the mountain dove, pearl-necked dove, lace-necked dove, and spotted turtle-dove.

Taxonomy
The spotted dove was formally described in 1786 by the Austrian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli and given the binomial name Columba chinensis. This species was formerly included in the genus Streptopelia. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2001 found the genus was paraphyletic with respect to Columba. To create monophyletic genera the spotted dove as well as the closely related laughing dove were moved to the resurrected genus Spilopelia that had been introduced by the Swedish z"

This bird is typically around 26 cm (10 in) in length. Its upper body, from shoulders to tail, is a pale grayish brown, though the wing edge has a bluish tinge. Flight feathers are darker, and nearly black. Head, neck and breast are pinkish shading to white on the chin and belly.  There is little sexual dimorphism.
The African collared dove is the species thought to be the wild ancestor of the domestic Barbary dove, though some suggest the Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto) may also have been involved. The African collared dove is able to hybridise with the Barbary dove, and it is thought that the increase in the range of colours of Barbary doves available that occurred in the later 20th century was the result of the importation of African collared doves into the United States for interbreeding.
It is reported to have been introduced into New Zealand, but it is more likely that the birds there are descended from domestic Barbary doves.
Streptopelia roseogrisea has a diet of grass seeds and other plants. They would also eat berries, insects, and snails.

It is known as the wild boar in Singapore. It is the most basal subspecies, having the smallest relative brain size, more primitive dentition, and unspecialised cranial structure. It is a short-faced subspecies with a white band on the muzzle, as well as sparse body hair, no underwool, a fairly long mane, and a broad reddish band extending from the muzzle to the sides of the neck. It is much smaller than the mainland S. s. cristatus subspecies, with the largest specimens on Komodo weighing only 48 kg.In some areas, it differs from most other boar populations by being highly frugivorous, with specimens in Ujung Kulon National Park in Java eating around 50 different fruit species, especially figs, thus making them important seed dispersers. On the islands of Komodo and Rinca, its diet is more varied, encompassing roots, tubers, grasses, insects, fruits, snakes, and carrion. It also frequently eats crabs during low tide. Piglets are born from December to March in litters of two to six, and are raised in grass nests constructed by their mother. They are much less vividly striped than the young of S. s. scrofa.On the islands of Komodo, Rinca, and Flores, the banded pig is a primary food source for Komodo dragons.

It is covered in fur and spines and has a distinctive snout and a specialised tongue, which it uses to catch its insect prey at a great speed. Like the other extant monotremes, the short-beaked echidna lays eggs; the monotremes are the only living group of mammals to do so.
The short-beaked echidna has extremely strong front limbs and claws, which allow it to burrow quickly with great power. As it needs to be able to survive underground, it has a significant tolerance to high levels of carbon dioxide and low levels of oxygen. It has no weapons or fighting ability but deters  predators by curling into a ball and deterring them with its spines. It lacks the ability to sweat and cannot deal with heat well, so it tends to avoid daytime activity in hot weather. It can swim if needed. The snout has mechanoreceptors and electroreceptors that help the echidna to detect its surroundings.
During the Australian winter, it goes into deep torpor and hibernation, reducing its metabolism to save energy. As the temperature increases, it emerges to mate. Female echidnas lay one egg a year and the mating period is the only time the otherwise solitary animals meet one another; the male has no further contact with the female or his offspring after mating.

First described by Mark Catesby in his 1743 The Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands, the chipmunk was eventually classified as Sciurus striatus by Linnaeus, meaning ""striped squirrel"" in Latin. The scientific name was changed to Tamias striatus, meaning ""striped steward,"" by Johann Illiger in 1811.

Description
A small species, it reaches about 30 cm (12 in) in length including the tail, and a weight of 66–150 g (2.3–5.3 oz).

Formerly considered a single species, Toxicodendron radicans, poison ivies are now generally treated as a complex of three separate species: Toxicodendron radicans, Toxicodendron rydbergii, and Toxicodendron orientale. They are well known for causing urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, an itchy, irritating, and sometimes painful rash, in most people who touch them. The rash is caused by urushiol, a clear liquid compound in the plant's sap. They are variable in appearance and habit, and despite its common name, it is not a ""true"" ivy (Hedera), but rather a member of the cashew and pistachio family (Anacardiaceae). T. radicans is commonly eaten by many animals, and the seeds are consumed by birds, but poison ivy is most often thought of as an unwelcome weed.

They are large for doves, and can be distinguished from similar doves by the distinctive white edge on their wings. They have a blue eyering, and red eyes. The plumage is brownish-gray to gray. Juveniles are duller in color, and have brown eyes. The call is likened to English phrase ""who cooks for you"". There are three subspecies. It was first described by George Edwards in 1743, and given its binomial name by Linnaeus in 1756. It was moved into the genus Zenaida in 1838.
They inhabit a variety of environments, including desert, scrub, and urban. Their diet consists mostly of grains, but will also include pollen and nectar, especially from the saguaro cactus, which is a vital source of water.
The expansion of humans has greatly affected the white-winged dove. Prior to human presence, their range closely mirrored that of their favorite food: the saguaro. The advent of agriculture in North America greatly expanded its range by providing a reliable food source. This has also led some modern populations to be migratory. Historically, they nested in enormous colonies, but most colonies have been lost due to human action and climatic factors, and most nesting is now isolated. It is hunted for sport, and is the second most shot game bird in the United States. Its population collapsed in the 1960s and 1970s, likely due t"
,대서양연어,Atlantic salmon,Salmo salar</em>,생태계위해우려생물,어류,Salmo salar,"The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae. It is the third largest of the Salmonidae, behind Siberian taimen and Pacific Chinook salmon, growing up to a meter in length. Atlantic salmon are found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and in rivers that flow into it. Most populations are anadromous, hatching in streams and rivers but moving out to sea as they grow where they mature, after which the adults seasonally move upstream again to spawn.When the mature fish re-enter rivers to spawn, they change in colour and appearance. Some populations of this fish only migrate to large lakes, and are ""landlocked"", spending their entire lives in freshwater. Such populations are found throughout the range of the species. Unlike Pacific species of salmon, S. salar is iteroparous, which means it can survive spawning and return to sea to repeat the process again in another year with 5-10% returning to the sea to spawn again. Such individuals can grow to extremely large sizes, although they are rare. The different life stages of the fish are known by many different names in English: alevin, fry, parr and smolt.
Atlantic salmon is considered a very healthy food and one of the fish with a more refined taste in many cultures. As such it features in numerous popular traditional cuisines and can fetch a higher price than some other fish. It has thus long been the target of recreational and commercial fishing, and this, as well as habitat destruction, ha"

It is the largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of 40 to 70 cm (16 to 28 in), and a body weight of 5 to 26 kg (11 to 57 lb). Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur, which insulates it against cold weather. Three of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws, its facial mask, and its ringed tail, which are themes in the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas relating to the animal. The raccoon is noted for its intelligence, as studies show that it is able to remember the solution to tasks for at least three years. It is usually nocturnal and omnivorous, eating about 40% invertebrates, 33% plants, and 27% vertebrates.
The original habitats of the raccoon are deciduous and mixed forests, but due to their adaptability, they have extended their range to mountainous areas, coastal marshes, and urban areas, where some homeowners consider them to be pests. As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century, raccoons are now also distributed across central Europe, the Caucasus, and Japan.
In Europe, the raccoon is included since 2016 in the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern (the Union list). This implies that this species cannot be imported, bred, transported, commercialized, or intentionally rele"

Its name is derived from the short black claws on its feet. The word Xenopus means 'strange foot' and laevis means 'smooth'.
The species is found throughout much of Sub-Saharan Africa (Nigeria and Sudan to South Africa), and in isolated, introduced populations in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. All species of the family Pipidae are tongueless, toothless and completely aquatic. They use their hands to shove food in their mouths and down their throats and a hyobranchial pump to draw or suck things in their mouth. Pipidae have powerful legs for swimming and lunging after food. They also use the claws on their feet to tear pieces of large food. They have no external eardrums, but instead subcutaneous cartilaginous disks that serve the same function. They use their sensitive fingers and sense of smell to find food. Pipidae are scavengers and will eat almost anything living, dying, or dead and any type of organic waste.
It is considered an invasive species in several countries, including across Europe.

These fish inhabit South American rivers, floodplains, lakes and reservoirs. Although often described as extremely predatory and mainly feeding on fish, their dietary habits vary extensively, and they will also take plant material, leading to their classification as omnivorous.

Etymology
The name originates from the indigenous Tupi people and their respective Tupi language. It is formed from two words, pirácode: tpw is deprecated  meaning fish and sainhacode: tpw is deprecated  meaning tooth; the same word is used by Indians to describe a pair of scissors. Another possible derivation is from pira nyacode: tpw is deprecated , probably literally 'biting-fish'. In the mid 18th century the Portuguese merged the word into piranha. Finally, the word may also come from the combination of pirácode: tpw is deprecated  'fish' and ánhacode: tpw is deprecated  'cut' (which also meant 'bad' or 'devil' in Tupi-Guarani).

Taxonomy and evolution
Piranhas belong to the subfamily Serrasalminae, which includes closely related omnivorous fish such as pacus. Traditionally, only the four genera Pristobrycon, Pygocentrus, Pygopristis, and Serrasalmus are considered to be true piranhas, due to their specialized teeth. However, a recent analysis showed, if the piranha gr"

It has spread invasively to Japan, South Korea, and the United States. Its preferred host is tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), but it infests crops including soybean, grapes, stone fruits, and Malus spp. In its native habitat, L. delicatula populations are regulated by parasitic wasps.
The spotted lanternfly's life cycle is often centered on its preferred host, Ailanthus altissima, but L. delicatula can associate with more than 173 plants. Early life stages (instars) of the spotted lanternfly are characterized by spotted black and white nymphs that develop a red pigmentation and wings as they mature. Early life instars have a large host range that narrows with maturation. Adult spotted lanternflies have a black head, grey wings, and red hind wings. Adults do not have any specialized feeding associations with herbaceous plants but cause extensive damage to crops and ornamental plants. The piercing wounds caused by their mouthparts and the honeydew waste they excrete are harmful to the health of host plants. Spotted lanternflies lay egg masses containing 30–50 eggs, often covered with a grayish mud-like coating. In temperate climates, these egg masses overwinter.The species was accidentally introduced into South Korea in 2006 and Japan in 2009, and has since been considered a pest.

Classified for a long time as the only member of the family Myocastoridae, Myocastor is now included within Echimyidae, the family of the spiny rats.
The nutria lives in burrows alongside stretches of water and feeds on river plant stems. Originally native to subtropical and temperate South America, it has since been introduced to North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, primarily by fur farmers. Although it is still hunted and trapped for its fur in some regions, its destructive burrowing and feeding habits often bring it into conflict with humans, and it is considered an invasive species. Nutria also transmit various diseases to humans and animals, mainly through water contamination.

Etymology
The genus name Myocastor derives from the two Ancient Greek words μῦς (mûs) 'rat, mouse', and κάστωρ (kástōr) 'beaver'. Literally, therefore, the name Myocastor means 'mouse beaver'.
Two names are commonly used in English for Myocastor coypus. The name nutria (from the Spanish word nutria 'otter') is generally used in North America, Asia, and throughout countries of the former Soviet Union; however, in most Spanish-speaking countries, the word nutria refers primarily to the otter. To avoid this ambiguity, the name coypu or coipo (derived from Mapudungun) is used in South America, Britain and other parts of Europe. In France, the nutria is known as a ragondin.

Its natural range extends from southeastern Canada, southwest to the edge of the Rocky Mountains, as far east as Nova Scotia and Florida. The three species of Chelydra and the larger alligator snapping turtles (genus Macrochelys) are the only extant chelydrids, a family now restricted to the Americas. The common snapping turtle, as its name implies, is the most widespread.The common snapping turtle is noted for its combative disposition when out of the water with its powerful beak-like jaws, and highly mobile head and neck (hence the specific epithet serpentina, meaning ""snake-like""). In water, it is likely to flee and hide underwater in sediment. The common snapping turtle has a life-history strategy characterized by high and variable mortality of embryos and hatchlings, delayed sexual maturity, extended adult longevity, and iteroparity (repeated reproductive events) with low reproductive success per reproductive event.Females, and presumably also males, in more northern populations mature later (at 15–20 years) and at a larger size than in more southern populations (about 12 years). Lifespan in the wild is poorly known, but long-term mark-recapture data from Algonquin Park in Ontario, Canada, suggest a maximum age over 100 years.

Appearance
Vespa velutina is significantly smaller than the European hornet. Typically, queens are 30 mm (1.2 in) in length, and males about 24 mm (0.95 in). Workers measure about 20 mm (0.80 in) in length. The species has distinctive yellow tarsi (legs). The thorax is a velvety brown or black with a brown abdomen. Each abdominal segment has a narrow posterior yellow border, except for the fourth segment, which is orange. The head is black and the face yellow. Regional forms vary sufficiently in color to cause difficulties in classification, and several subspecies have been variously identified and ultimately rejected; while a history of recognizing subspecies within many of the Vespa species exists, including V. velutina, the most recent taxonomic revision of the genus treats all subspecific names in the genus Vespa as synonyms, effectively relegating them to no more than informal names for regional color forms. The color form causing concern about its invasiveness in Europe has been referred to as V. v. nigrithorax, though this name no longer has any taxonomic standing.

P. concinna is found from Virginia south to central Georgia, west to eastern Texas, Oklahoma, and north to southern Indiana.

Habitat
P. concinna is usually found in rivers with moderate current, as well as lakes and tidal marshes.

Subspecies
There are two subspecies which are recognized as being valid.
Pseudemys concinna concinna (LeConte, 1830) – eastern river cooter

The plants flower in spring of the next year, producing cross-shaped white flowers in dense clusters. As the flowering stems bloom they elongate into a spike-like shape. When flowering is complete, plants produce upright fruits that release seeds in mid-summer. Plants are often found growing along the margins of hedges, giving rise to the old British folk name of jack-by-the-hedge. Other common names include: garlic mustard, garlic root, hedge garlic, sauce-alone, jack-in-the-bush, penny hedge and poor man's mustard.

This is a perennial grass forming clumps and spreading via rhizomes and stolons. It grows decumbent or erect to a maximum height near 60 centimeters. The inflorescence is usually divided into two branches lined with spikelets.
Paspalum distichum is a food source for several avian species, including the long-tailed widowbird.

Appearance
P. clarkii is typically dark red, with long claws and head, small or no spines on the sides of its carapace just below the head, and rows of bright red bumps on the front and side of the first leg.

Range and range expansion
The native range of P. clarkii is from northern Mexico and far southeastern New Mexico, through the Gulf States to the Florida Panhandle, as well as inland north through the Mississippi Basin to southern Illinois and Ohio. It has also been introduced, sometimes deliberately, outside its natural range to countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and elsewhere in the Americas. In northern Europe, the populations are self-maintaining but not expanding, while in southern Europe, P. clarkii is multiplying and actively colonizing new territories at the expense of the native crayfish, Astacus astacus and Austropotamobius spp. Individuals are reported to be able to cross many miles of relatively dry ground, especially in wet seasons, although the aquarium trade and anglers may have hastened the spread in some areas (anglers using P. clarkii as fishing bait are thought to have introduced it to the state of Washington).

It is commonly called hairy white oldfield aster, frost aster, white heath aster, heath aster, hairy aster, common old field aster, old field aster, awl aster, nailrod, and steelweed. There are two varieties: Symphyotrichum pilosum var. pilosum, known by the common names previously listed, and Symphyotrichum pilosum var. pringlei, known as Pringle's aster. Both varieties are conservationally secure globally and in most provinces and states where they are native.
The varieties differ in morphology, distribution, and habitat; S. pilosum var. pilosum is hairy, and S. pilosum var. pringlei is hairless, or nearly so. S. pilosum var. pilosum is the more widespread of the two and grows in various dry habitats, often with weeds. S. pilosum var. pringlei grows in higher-quality calcium-rich ecosystems, often with many non-weedy companion flora. S. pilosum has been introduced to several European and Asian countries.

Recent studies have concluded that the correct binomial name for the Florida bass is Labrus salmoides, while the oldest available binomial for the largemouth bass is Cuvier's Huro nigricans. It is the largest species of the black bass, with a maximum recorded length of 29.5 inches (75 cm) and an unofficial weight of 25 pounds 1 ounce (11.4 kg).
The largemouth bass is the state fish of Georgia and Mississippi, and the state freshwater fish of Florida and Alabama. It is a highly prized sport fish among anglers for their vigorous resistance when caught, and have been introduced to many regions due to their popularity in bass fishing and tolerance to urban streams. However, they have become an invasive species in some areas, causing the decline, displacement or extinction of native species through predation and competition.

A member of the genus Solenopsis in the subfamily Myrmicinae, it was described by Swiss entomologist Felix Santschi as a variant of S. saevissima in 1916. Its current specific name invicta was given to the ant in 1972 as a separate species. However, the variant and species were the same ant, and the name was preserved due to its wide use. Though South American in origin, the red imported fire ant has been accidentally introduced in Australia, New Zealand, several Asian and Caribbean countries, Europe and the United States. The red imported fire ant is polymorphic, as workers appear in different shapes and sizes. The ant's colours are red and somewhat yellowish with a brown or black gaster, but males are completely black. Red imported fire ants are dominant in altered areas and live in a wide variety of habitats. They can be found in rainforests,  disturbed areas, deserts, grasslands, alongside roads and buildings, and in electrical equipment. Colonies form large mounds constructed from soil with no visible entrances because foraging tunnels are built and workers emerge far away from the nest.
These ants exhibit a wide variety of behaviours, such as building rafts when they sense that water levels are rising. They also show necrophoric behaviour, where nestmates discard scraps or dead ants on refuse piles outside the nest. Foraging takes place on war"

Brown trout are highly adaptable and have evolved numerous ecotypes/subspecies. These include three main ecotypes: a riverine ecotype called river trout or Salmo trutta morpha fario; a lacustrine ecotype or S. trutta morpha lacustris, also called the lake trout (not to be confused with the lake trout in North America); and anadromous populations known as the sea trout or S. trutta morpha trutta, which upon adulthood migrate downstream to the oceans for much of its life and only returns to fresh water to spawn in the gravel beds of headstreams. Sea trout in Ireland and Great Britain have many regional names: sewin in Wales, finnock in Scotland, peal in the West Country, mort in North West England, and white trout in Ireland.
The lacustrine and riverine morphs of brown trout are both potamodromous, meaning they are also migratory, though only between freshwater bodies. Lacustrine trout mainly inhabit large lakes with calm and stratified deep water, while riverine trout forms fluvial populations typically in large rivers but sometimes in shallower creeks and alpine streams, both still migrating upstream during reproductive seasions.

It is the type species of the genus Lepomis (true sunfish), from the family Centrarchidae (sunfishes, crappies and black basses) in the order Perciformes (perch-like fish). 
Bluegills can grow up to 12 in (30 cm) long and about 4+1⁄2 lb (2.0 kg). While their color can vary from population to population, they typically have a very distinctive coloring, with deep blue and purple on the face and gill cover, dark olive-colored bands down the side, and a fiery orange to yellow belly. They are omnivorous and will consume anything they can fit in their mouth, but mostly feed on small aquatic insects and baitfishes. The fish are important prey for bass, other larger sunfish, northern pike and muskellunge, walleye, trout, herons, kingfishers, snapping turtles and otters, and play a key role within the food chain of its freshwater ecosystem.
A popular panfish among anglers, bluegill usually hide around and inside old tree stumps in swamps and other underwater structures (e.g. snags), and can live in either deep or very shallow water. Bluegills also like to find shelter among aquatic plants and in the shade of trees along banks, and will often move from one cover to another depending on the time of day or season."

It is found throughout northern Mexico, the central United States and southern Ontario, Canada. It is considered a pest over most of its range.

Description
Adult males grow to 28–37 mm, and females grow to 34–50 mm. They are brownish or greenish, and as they age the color will darken. Some nymphs can be bright yellow. There are black grooves on the pronotum. The male has bootlike appendages at the end of its abdominal tip. There are inverted chevrons along the hind femur, and the hind part of the tibia is yellowish with black spikes. All adults have yellow tarsi and antennae, or in some cases reddish-yellow antennae.

Range and habitat
The differential grasshopper is found throughout most of the United States, except for the northwest. Within its range, it is most often found in heavily weeded areas and grasslands, and even in vacant lots and other urban areas.

This invasive species was inadvertently introduced by humans on a global scale and has become established in many Mediterranean climate areas, including South Africa, New Zealand, Japan, Easter Island, Australia, Europe, Hawaii, and the continental United States. Argentine ants are significant pests within agricultural and urban settings, and are documented to cause substantial harm to communities of native arthropods, vertebrates, and plants within their invaded range.

Description
Linepithema humile is a small-bodied (2.2–2.6 mm) ant species, dull light to dark brown in color. Within the invasion zone, ant colonies are large and include many workers and multiple queens.Argentine ants are opportunistic with regard to nesting preferences. Colony nests have been found in the ground, in cracks in concrete walls, in spaces between boards and timbers, even among belongings in human dwellings. In natural areas, they generally nest shallowly in loose leaf litter or beneath small stones, due to their poor ability to dig deeper nests. However, if a deeper nesting ant species abandons their nest, Argentine ant colonies will readily take over the space. Because the native habitat for this species is within riparian floodplains, colonies are very sensitive to water infiltration within their nests; if their nests become inundated wit"

It is the largest freshwater species of turtle in North America. It is often associated with, but not closely related to, the common snapping turtle, which is in the genus Chelydra. The specific epithet temminckii is in honor of Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck.

Taxonomy
Although it was once believed that only one extant species exists in the genus Macrochelys, recent studies have shown that there are two species, the other being the Suwannee snapping turtle (M. suwanniensis) of the Suwannee River. A third species, the Apalachicola snapping turtle (M. apalachicolae), has been proposed, but is generally not recognized.The alligator snapping turtle is given its common name because of its immensely powerful jaws and distinct ridges on its shell that are similar in appearance to the rough, ridged skin of an alligator.

It is common in much of its range and fairly tolerant of landscapes which have been disturbed by humans. It has become naturalized in many parts of the world.

Description
Solidago altissima is one to two meters (40 to 80 inches) in height with fine hairs on the stem. The leaves are located along the stem, not in a rosette near the ground. One plant can produce as many as 1500 small yellow flower heads in a large conical array. The involucres of the main subspecies (S. a. subsp. altissima) are usually 3–4 millimeters, whereas those of S. a. subsp. gilvocanescens are usually 2–3 mm.

This species has a pan-tropical distribution.

Distribution
Solenopsis geminata is native to Central and South America, including the Caribbean islands, but has since spread throughout the tropics by human means. It is an invasive species with a world-wide distribution even greater than that of other invasive fire ant species such as Solenopsis invicta (red imported fire ant).

Colonies and reproduction
S. geminata build their nests primarily in the soil in open, sunny areas. The nests are formed, some as craters or mounds, up to 2 feet wide and 12 inches tall with multiple entrance holes up to some 20 per nest. The number of mounds varies greatly, from 10 to 80 per acre in native habitats to up to 1000 or even 1500 mounds per acre in areas where they are introduced.The colonies can either be monogyne, containing a single queen, or polygyne, containing many reproductive queens. They are known to hybridize with other closely related fire ant species. Queens may start a new colony following a nuptial flight. 
Otherwise, like other fire ants, they are known to spread by floating.
Globally they can expand over long distances by jump-dispersal through human-mediated transport and invade new areas.

Venom

It is one of the two most commonly found species used for divination that have been recovered from Shang dynasty sites, despite the Shang capital being over 1000 km north of its modern-day distribution range.

Description
Chinese-stripe-necked turtles have a green body. As a juvenile, its carapace is grayish green and there are three distinctive ridges. As an adult, the color fades to a brown color and the two ridges gradually disappear. The plastron is ivory in color with small black spots. The male's tail is more coarse and long, while adult females will be larger than the males.

Habitat
Chinese stripe-necked turtles prefer lowland waters such as ponds, canals, and slow-moving rivers. Climate is very important when sustaining a risk of invasion, since the turtles become naturalized in areas with a suitable climate.

Distribution
The Chinese stripe-necked turtle is found in China (Hainan, Guangdong & Fujian), Taiwan and northern & central Vietnam. There were hatchlings in the Torre Flavia wetland (coast of central Italy). This resulted in the idea that there is naturalization of the local population.

Etymology
The specific name, nelsoni, is in honor of American biologist George Nelson (born 1873).

Geographic range
P. nelsoni is endemic to Florida, and southern Georgia. Fossils of P. nelsoni have also been found along the coast of South Carolina from the Pleistocene Epoch, indicating that the historic range of this species used to extend further north. Today, its northern counterpart, the Northern Red-bellied Cooter (Psuedemys rubriventris) occupies this region.

Biology
The Florida redbelly cooter is mainly herbivorous, and can be found in nearly any type of aquatic habitat. It feeds on a variety of aquatic plants including waterweed (Vallisneria and Elodea), duckweed (Lemna and Wolffia), and arrowhead (Sagittaria) species. It reaches particularly high densities in spring runs, and occasionally can be found in brackish water. It appears to have an intermediate salinity tolerance compared to true freshwater forms and the highly specialized terrapin (Malachemys). This species is active year-round and spends a large portion of the day basking on logs. They are noted for sometimes laying their eggs in the nest mounds of alligators. Sex is temperature-dependent with males being born at cooler temperatures and females being born at warmer temperatures with a pivotal temperature of about 28.5 °C.

Since its arrival in North America, it has spread widely. It can be found throughout the Northeastern U.S. and eastern Canada, and considered an invasive species in North America. It also features on the list of invasive alien species of Union Concern since 2019. This means it can no longer be imported in the European Union. Additionally, it has become illegal to plant it, breed it, transport it, or bring it into the wild in all Member States.

It typically inhabits large permanent water bodies such as swamps, ponds, and lakes. Bullfrogs can also be found in manmade habitats such as pools, koi ponds, canals, ditches and culverts. The bullfrog gets its name from the sound the male makes during the breeding season, which sounds similar to a bull bellowing. The bullfrog is large and is commonly eaten throughout its range, especially in the southern United States where they are plentiful.
Their presence as a food source has led to bullfrogs being distributed around the world outside of their native range. Bullfrogs have been introduced into the Western United States, South America, Western Europe, China, Japan, and southeast Asia. In these places they are invasive species due to their voracious appetite and the large number of eggs they produce, having a negative effect on native amphibians and other fauna. Bullfrogs are very skittish which makes capture difficult and so they often become established.
Other than for food, bullfrogs are also used for dissection in science classes. Albino bullfrogs are sometimes kept as pets, and bullfrog tadpoles are often sold at pond or fish stores.

Three subspecies are described, the most recognizable of which is the red-eared slider (T. s. elegans), which is popular in the pet trade and has been introduced to other parts of the world by people releasing it to the wild. Hatchling and juvenile pond sliders have a green upper shell (carapace), yellow bottom shell (plastron), and green and yellow stripes and markings on their skin. These patterns and colors in the skin and shell fade with age until the carapace is a muted olive green to brown and the plastron is a dull yellow or darker. Some sliders become almost black with few visible markings.
The carapace is oval with a bit of rounding and a central crest with knobs, but these features soften and fade with age, adults being smoother and flatter. For determining an adult slider's sex, males typically have much longer front claws than adult females, while females usually have shorter, more slender tails than males. Their lifespans range from 20 to 50 years.

Etymology
The origin of the name slider stems from the behavior of these turtles when startled. Groups of sliders, sometimes quite large, as well as many other types of less abundant freshwater turtles, are often seen basking and sunning on logs, branches, and vegetation at or even well above the water's surface, but they readily and quickly scramble if they sense danger, shooting back in and darting away to safety underwater"
